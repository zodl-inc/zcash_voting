# zcash_voting

Client-side cryptographic library for Zcash shielded voting. Implements proof generation, vote construction, and tree synchronization for the [Zally governance protocol](https://github.com/valargroup/shielded-vote-book).

## Workspace Crates

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **zcash_voting** | Core library: ZKP delegation and vote proofs (Halo2), El Gamal encryption, governance PCZT construction, Merkle witness generation, chain confirmation parsing, SQLite round-state persistence |
| **vote-commitment-tree** | Append-only Poseidon Merkle tree for Vote Authority Notes and Vote Commitments |
| **vote-commitment-tree-client** | HTTP client and CLI for syncing the vote commitment tree from a chain node |

## Architecture

```
zcash_voting
├── config ───────────────────── config resolution + switch decisions
├── vote-commitment-tree-client ─ vote-commitment-tree
├── pir-client / vote-nullifier-pir types
├── voting-circuits ───────────── ZK delegation + vote proofs
└── librustzcash crates ───────── pczt, zcash_keys, zcash_client_sqlite, ...
```

The config resolver itself is transport-agnostic. Wallets choose the static
config source and network transport, fetch bytes, and pass those bytes into
`zcash_voting::config`. The `wallet-example::example_config` module shows a
direct HTTPS implementation for Rust consumers that do not need a custom
transport.

## Building

```bash
cargo check                    # check all crates
cargo build -p zcash_voting   # build just the core library
```

Run the Ironwood / NU6.3 tests with:

```bash
cargo test -p zcash_voting --locked
```

## Wallet API Lifecycle

New wallet integrations should import `zcash_voting::prelude::*` and use the
stage-oriented API:

- `round::*` creates rounds and binds eligible notes into bundles.
- `precompute::*` prepares shielded note witnesses, delegation PIR inputs, and VAN
  witnesses for vote proofs.
- `delegate::*` builds delegation PCZTs, proves delegation, prepares signing
  requests, and assembles signed delegation submissions. Wallets keep root seed
  material outside this crate, sign requests at the wallet boundary, and pass
  only signature bytes back through `PreparedSigner::signature`.
- `confirmation::*` parses delegation and cast-vote tx events, then records tx
  hashes and tree positions atomically.
- `vote::*` builds ZKP #2, signs cast-vote payloads, persists the canonical
  `VoteRecoveryBundle`, and reconstructs vote-chain submissions after a crash.
- `share::*` recovers helper-share payloads, computes share nullifiers, applies
  share scheduling policy, and records helper-share confirmation state.
- `session::*` records durable ballot intent and returns a round-level
  `RoundPlan` with ordered `NextStep`s for restart recovery. Wallets should
  write `Decision::Choice` with the proposal's declared option count before
  starting a cast-vote flow, write `Decision::Skipped` with the same option
  count for proposals the user intentionally leaves blank, and use `resume_plan`
  after restart to decide whether to delegate, poll delegation/vote
  transactions, cast remaining votes, or confirm helper shares.
  `CastVote` steps include the recorded choice. `SubmitVote` steps mean a vote
  was already committed locally and should be reconstructed with
  `vote::submission` rather than rebuilt from a draft. Submit those recovered
  cast-vote fields, persist the cast-vote tx hash with `vote::record_submission`
  while polling, then record confirmed tx events with
  `confirmation::confirm_vote_submission`. After confirmation, call
  `vote::recover_commit` again and use its helper-share payloads so they carry
  the confirmed VC position. Persist each accepted helper share with
  `share::record`, and re-run the planner because later work may depend on
  on-chain confirmations. `open_proposals` contains only proposals with no
  terminal decision yet.

## Migrating 0.11 to 0.12

- Replace `VotingDb::build_vote_commitment` + `vote_commitment::sign_cast_vote`
  + `VotingDb::build_share_payloads` orchestration with `vote::commit`.
- Replace custom cast-vote recovery JSON with `vote::serialize_recovery` and
  `vote::parse_recovery`.
- Replace direct `VoteTreeSync` ownership with
  `precompute::{sync_vote_tree, van_witness, reset_vote_tree}`.
- Replace direct `share_tracking` calls with `share::*`, and `share_policy`
  imports with `share::policy::*`.
- Replace raw vote/share workflow SQL with
  `VotingDb::{vote_phase, vote_phases, share_phase, share_phases}`.
- Replace wallet-local "what comes next" recovery planning with
  `session::resume_plan`; fetch execution material through crate APIs such as
  `vote::submission`, `vote::recover_commit`, `share::*`, and the tx hash
  accessors, then keep wallet-specific networking, proof execution, and UI
  routing at the wallet boundary.
- Replace wallet-local delegation proof and signing orchestration with
  `delegate::PreparedDelegationBundle`. Callers can use the prepared lifecycle
  for setup, witness completion, proving, signing request construction, signed
  payload assembly, and Keystone request construction.
- Use `confirmation::{confirm_delegation_submission, confirm_vote_submission}`
  after chain clients report confirmed delegation or cast-vote tx events. The
  confirmation API parses the chain `leaf_index` events and records tx hashes,
  VAN positions, and VC positions atomically.
- Use `vote::commit`, `vote::submission`, `vote::recover_commit`,
  `vote::record_submission`, and `vote::record_vc_position` for the cast-vote
  lifecycle. Wallets should not write recovery JSON, submission flags, or vote
  commitment positions directly.

Pre-launch wallet databases with older schema versions are reset when opened by
this branch; callers that need to preserve test data should export it before
upgrading the crate.

The workspace uses the published `voting-circuits 0.9.0-rc.3` release.

## Dependency Strategy

The root manifest selects one upstream Ironwood dependency stack for every
workspace member:

- **`orchard 0.15`** from [zcash/orchard](https://github.com/zcash/orchard),
  with `unstable-voting-circuits` enabled for the governance proof paths.
- **`pczt`, `zcash_client_backend`, `zcash_client_sqlite`, `zcash_keys`,
  `zcash_primitives`, and `zcash_protocol`** from a pinned upstream
  librustzcash revision containing Ironwood historical note selection.
- **`voting-circuits 0.9.0-rc.3`** from
  [valargroup/voting-circuits](https://github.com/valargroup/voting-circuits)
  for the delegation and vote proof circuits.

`Cargo.toml` is the source of truth for version and feature requirements, and
`Cargo.lock` records the exact package sources and versions used by this branch.
The Zcash wallet crates require Rust 1.88 or newer.

## FFI

Mobile FFI bindings live in [zcash-swift-wallet-sdk](https://github.com/valargroup/zcash-swift-wallet-sdk) (hand-rolled C FFI + Swift wrappers). This repo is a pure Rust workspace.

//! The chain transport that dies mid-POST.
//!
//! The broadcast boundary is the one crash point no event stream can express.
//! It lives inside a single transport call, between the instruction that
//! releases the request and the one that records what came back, and the SDK
//! draws its whole ambiguity model across it: everything before
//! `ChainPostDispatch::mark_possible` is definitely unsent, everything after is
//! possibly dispatched. Wrapping the real transport is therefore the only
//! honest way to test it — the wrapper delegates to the same HTTP client the
//! wallet would use, so the transaction that reaches staging is a real one.

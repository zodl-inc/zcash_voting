# Changelog
All notable changes to this workspace will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this workspace adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- `zcash_voting::backend::{incrementalmerkletree, zip32}` reexport the selected
  backend's `incrementalmerkletree` and `zip32` crates.

### Changed

- `zcash_voting` now requires `zakura-wallet-lib` `^0.1.0-rc6` instead of
  exactly `0.1.0-rc6`.
- The `lrz` backend moved to the librustzcash NU7 pre-releases:
  `zcash_protocol =0.11.0-pre.0`, `zcash_client_backend =0.25.0-pre.1`,
  `zcash_client_sqlite =0.23.0-pre.1`, `zcash_keys =0.17.0-pre.1`,
  `pczt =0.10.0-pre.1`, `zcash_primitives =0.31.0-pre.1`, and `orchard` 0.16,
  with `incrementalmerkletree` 0.9 and `zip32` 0.3. Types from these crates in
  the `zcash_voting` API, including `zip32::Scope` and `zcash_voting::backend`,
  change accordingly.
- Under `lrz`, `vote-commitment-tree` uses `incrementalmerkletree` 0.9 and
  `shardtree` 0.8 in its API (`GenericTreeServer`'s `ShardStore` bound and
  `MerklePath`'s `From` conversion). Under `zakura` they remain 0.8 and 0.7.
- Under `lrz`, the governance PCZT's output `user_address` is a ZIP 316
  Revision 2 (`zu`) Unified Address encoding.
- Both backends now resolve on the stable `bip32` 0.6 / `secp256k1` 0.33
  stack. Until the corresponding releases are published, a consumer must
  declare this workspace's `[patch.crates-io]` table. Under `zakura`, the
  transparent signing APIs reexported through `zcash_voting::backend` no
  longer take a secp256k1 context.

## v5.1.1-rc.3

`zcash_voting` 5.1.1-rc.3 keeps the 5.1.1-rc.2 dependency stack and gates the
regtest `NetworkUpgrade::Nu7` arm behind the Zakura feature so the LRZ backend
continues to build against crates.io `zcash_protocol 0.10`.

## v5.1.1-rc.2

`zcash_voting` 5.1.1-rc.2 aligns on the published Zakura cryptography `2.0.0`
stack and supporting crate releases:

- `zakura-wallet-lib 0.1.0-rc6`
- `voting-circuits 0.12.2` and `voting-crypto-deps 0.2.4`
- `imt-tree 0.5.4`, `pir-types 0.6.4`, and `pir-client 0.7.4`
- `vote-commitment-tree 0.6.3` and `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.8.3`

The Zakura path depends on `zakura-protocol 2.0.0` under the `zcash_protocol`
import name; the LRZ path keeps crates.io `zcash_protocol 0.10.4`. Spiral
remains at `valar-spiral-rs 0.5.3-rc.1` with `valar-ypir 0.2.1`.

## v5.1.1-rc.1

`zcash_voting` 5.1.1-rc.1 updates Spiral to `valar-spiral-rs 0.5.3-rc.1` and
YPIR to published `valar-ypir 0.2.1`.

## v5.1.0

### Added

- Opt-in Ledger output review through
  `DelegationPipeline::with_ledger_output_review()` and
  `DelegationKeys::with_ledger_output_review()`. New delegation requests use
  the account's external outgoing viewing key and a printable ASCII memo so
  Ledger can review the existing zero-value hotkey output. The outgoing
  viewing key holder can recover the hotkey address and delegation memo from
  the submitted action, without gaining signing authority. Configure this
  before the first delegation setup; saved requests are reused unchanged.
  Existing callers retain the default behavior. No database, circuit, or
  vote-chain update is required. See
  [Ledger output review](docs/delegation-signing-transaction.md#ledger-output-review).

## v5.0.2

`zcash_voting` 5.0.2 updates `vote-commitment-tree` to 0.6.2 and
`vote-commitment-tree-client` to 0.8.2.

### Fixed

- Reserved the SQLite WAL writer before `store_vote` reads existing vote state,
  preventing concurrent vote-commitment persistence from failing immediately
  with `database is locked` instead of honoring the configured busy timeout.
- Reject over-capacity leaves and non-increasing checkpoints from vote-tree
  endpoints with typed sync errors instead of panicking the wallet.
- Try configured vote-chain replicas in order during exact commitment-tree
  recovery, restarting each replica from its own fixed snapshot and refusing
  to fail over from ambiguous duplicate-layout evidence.

## v5.0.1

`zcash_voting` 5.0.1 supersedes 5.0.0 for wallet integrations. Version 5.0.0
rejects an authenticated vote-chain configuration containing more than eight
endpoints before making a network request.

### Fixed

- Allow chain submission clients to configure up to 100 vote-chain endpoints,
  while retaining the separate limit of eight submission attempts.

## v5.0.0

> **Known issue:** Version 5.0.0 rejects vote-chain configurations containing
> more than eight endpoints. Use 5.0.1 instead.

`zcash_voting` 5.0.0 moves round execution, chain submission/recovery, and
helper-share tracking into the SDK. Wallet integrations must adapt their
orchestration and bindings; this is not a dependency-only upgrade.

See [Migrating to v5](docs/migrating-to-v5.md) for the **v3.x → v5.0.x** and
**v4.0.x → v5.0.x** upgrade paths, API replacements, and database restrictions.
The notes below describe the final v5 API relative to v3.1.0. Integrations on
v3.0.x or v4.0.x also need the guide's earlier integration changes.

V5 includes the v4.0.x line's support for proposal IDs 1–50 (still 16 encrypted
shares per vote), SQLite immediate-transaction fixes, explicit LRZ selection,
and Rust 1.91 minimum. It supersedes the v4 prerelease dependency stack; the
v4 release entries below retain their original version requirements.

### Breaking changes

- **Round orchestration:** use `RoundDriver::run` over a bound `RoundExecutor`
  to execute and resume a round. The SDK selects work from durable state and
  returns a `RoundRunReport` with progress, partial failures, and a typed stop
  reason. Hosts supply ballot decisions, signing, authenticated configuration,
  current timing, transport, and cancellation.
- **Chain submission:** `ChainSubmissionClient` owns request construction,
  dispatch, polling, recovery, and confirmation. Public payload builders,
  host-parsed confirmation APIs, and writers for transaction hashes and VAN/VC
  positions are removed. A transaction hash alone is not confirmation;
  exact-tree recovery may confirm a vote without one.
- **Atomic transactions:** fresh local delegation and chosen votes use
  `delegate-and-cast-vote-batch`, including a single chosen proposal. Voting
  through an existing delegation batches multiple due proposals with
  `cast-vote-batch`; one proposal uses `cast-vote`. Target chains must support
  these routes and the 50-proposal circuit/verifying keys. There is no fallback
  from the combined route. Batch members are publicly linked as one transaction.
- **Delegation signing and proving:** use `DelegationPipeline` or
  `PreparedDelegationBundle::ensure_proof`; the direct
  `VotingDb::build_and_prove_delegation` method is removed. Software wallets
  supply a `SpendAuthSigner`; Keystone wallets supply device signatures. Chain
  advancement takes the signature and reloads its authoritative signing context
  from storage. Imported delegations remain signer-free and poll-only.
- **Helper shares:** initial submission is now available through
  `ConfirmedVote::submit_prepared_shares`, after converting a committed vote
  with `CommittedVote::confirmed`. Replace host tracking timers with
  `ShareTrackingDriver::run` and pending-round enumeration with
  `share::pending_rounds_for_accounts`. Public host-cadence helpers are removed.
- **Bindings and storage handles:** `VotingDb::open_wallet_sidecar` returns
  `Arc<VotingDb>`; `scoped` returns `Result` and rejects an empty wallet ID.
  `set_ballot_intents` requires the expected network. Wire step kinds, primary
  actions, recovery kinds, and phases use typed enums; submission/poll kinds
  become advancement kinds. Delegation recovery VAN positions are `u64`.
  Update exhaustive matches for typed errors and newly non-exhaustive reports.
- **Transport:** `HyperTransport` is generic over `RouteHttp`; PIR proof
  consumers accept `&dyn PirProofSource`. Custom routes must follow the dispatch
  hook contract and explicitly declare any connection-timeout enforcement.
- **Database compatibility:** launched schemas upgrade in place to version 24,
  but migration does not adopt legacy submissions into the new chain lifecycle.
  Upgrading with an in-flight legacy submission is unsupported. Standalone
  recovery-clearing APIs are removed, reset preserves submission evidence, and
  ordinary round deletion refuses broadcast delegation state. See the guide
  before upgrading an active wallet.

### Added

- `RoundDriver` and `ShareTrackingDriver` provide SDK-owned execution loops,
  cancellation, progress events, and explicit reasons for stopping. Round
  reports include signed delegation bundles and durable effects even when a
  later step fails. `ProgressBaseline::SelectedChoices` supports a stable
  selected-vote progress total across restarts.
- `DelegationPipeline` shares bundle setup, eligibility, PIR preparation,
  proving, and signing between foreground and background work. Keystone
  requests retain the exact signing transaction across proof warmup and restart.
- `PirFleet`, `PirSession`, and `PirProofSource` provide ordered endpoint
  failover. `RouteHttp` lets hosts route PIR, vote-tree, helper, and chain HTTP
  traffic through one Tor/proxy integration.
- Optional per-invocation `*_with_report` APIs return `OperationReport<T>` with
  bounded proof, chain, and helper diagnostics, including on failure. Existing
  plain workflow variants remain available. See [observability](docs/observability.md).
- A shared proving runtime with `ProvingPolicy` controls CPU workers and active
  heavy jobs independently. Configure it before the first proof or cache warmup;
  defaults use available parallelism, with a 64 MiB stack per worker.
- [Staging benchmarks](stage-bench/README.md) and
  [bundle-pipeline benchmarks](docs/bundle_pipeline_benchmark.md) measure full
  voting flows and proof/delivery concurrency. They are opt-in and separate from
  the normal test suite.

### Changed

- Round execution overlaps up to five independent bundles by default; a
  `StopRound` failure policy remains serial. Proof work uses the shared runtime.
  Initial helper delivery admits up to 50 active share workflows with an
  independent 128-POST ceiling and accounts for helper fan-out before starting
  delivery deadlines.
- The round's designated immediate share is dispatched first when available,
  with a bounded wait across concurrent bundles. Default foreground planning
  requests confirmation only for that share; remaining shares are tracked in
  the background. The durable designation survives restarts and roster changes.
- Planning uses one consistent snapshot and reports missing bundle setup,
  unfinished ballots, per-bundle signing needs, terminal submissions, and
  background shares explicitly. Recovery continues for dispatched votes even
  if their proposals leave the roster; undispatched obsolete work can be retired.
- PIR requests split a 60-second budget across two timeout-bounded attempts,
  allowing quicker detection of stalled connections while retaining time for
  slow transfers. Custom connectors must implement the documented connection
  deadline contract to gain the early timeout behavior.
- Config resolution accepts both `vote_protocol` generations `v0` and `v1`.
  This does not substitute for chain support for the required transaction routes.
- Release dependencies are `voting-crypto-deps 0.2.3`,
  `voting-circuits 0.12.1`, `imt-tree 0.5.3`, `pir-types 0.6.3`,
  `pir-client 0.7.3`, and `zakura-wallet-lib 0.1.0-rc5`.
  Supporting crates are `vote-commitment-tree 0.6.1` and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.8.1`. Rust 1.91 or newer is required.

### Fixed

- Interrupted chain submissions perform recovery in the first resumed run.
  Ambiguous POSTs, including replaced gateway responses, retain recovery state
  and ballot locks. Exact-tree recovery is resource-bounded, validates tree
  positions, and preserves progress when a later operation fails.
- Tree-confirmed votes advance subsequent proposals and prevent conflicting
  ballot edits or rebuilds even without a transaction hash. Failed tree syncs
  no longer leave cached state that poisons later attempts.
- Combined delegation-and-vote confirmation reads the chain's `nullifier_count`
  event correctly. Definite first-POST rejection retires the combined batch for
  a fresh cast while retaining delegation setup; ambiguous dispatch remains
  recoverable. Rejection streaks reset on a relevant ballot edit or setup rebuild.
- Helper attempts are durably journaled in release builds as well as debug
  builds. Cancellation, partial failures, and restarts preserve accepted and
  outcome-unknown deliveries. Attempt-bound ingress-timeout receipts allow safe
  retries when a helper proves the attempt was not enqueued.
- Shared sidecar handles coordinate submission, proof production, and tree
  state across opens and path aliases. Account/session changes interrupt stale
  work, and concurrent writers report typed `DbBusy` errors rather than relying
  on message parsing.
- Schema upgrades preserve delegation, vote, share, and recovery material and
  repair recognized preview/schema drift, including a missing
  `chain_submissions` table. Unrecognized submission-tracking rows may be
  discarded during repair; unknown combined-preview schemas fail without
  rewriting stored state.
- Delegation setup and Keystone signatures survive proof warmup, cancellation,
  restart, and other bundles advancing first. Stale signing context cannot
  overwrite a replacement setup, and imported delegations no longer prompt for
  signatures their holders cannot provide.
- Progress and diagnostics retain the correct round, bundle, proposal, and
  share attribution, including cached-proof reuse, partial delivery, and
  privacy-trimmed bundle counts.

## v4.0.0-rc.1

This LRZ maintenance release builds on `v4.0.0-rc.0`; it does not contain the
v5 orchestration API overhaul.

### Changed

- Updated the release stack to `voting-crypto-deps 0.2.3`,
  `voting-circuits 0.12.0`, and `imt-tree 0.5.3`, with supporting
  `vote-commitment-tree 0.6.1` and `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.8.1` releases.
- Added the explicit `lrz` feature for consumers disabling default features.
- Raised the minimum supported Rust version from 1.88 to 1.91.

## v4.0.0-rc.0

This maintenance line is based on `v3.0.0`, not `v3.1.0`.

### Changed

- Expanded proposal IDs from 1–15 to 1–50 while retaining 16 encrypted shares
  per vote commitment. This requires the breaking circuit and verifying-key
  change in `voting-circuits 0.12.0-rc.2`.

### Fixed

- Voting writes that validate durable state before updating it use SQLite
  immediate transactions, preventing stale-snapshot `database is locked`
  failures during submission and confirmation, including VC-position and
  helper-share writes.

## v3.1.0

### Changed

- Released the exact `v3.1.0-rc.16` implementation as `v3.1.0` without
  implementation changes. Its supporting production snapshots were released
  as `pir-types 0.6.2`, `pir-client 0.7.2`, `voting-circuits 0.11.2`,
  `vote-commitment-tree 0.6.0`, and `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.8.0`.

## v3.1.0-rc.16

### Changed

- Local voting-hotkey delegation now derives each bundle's VAN blinding from
  the stored hotkey secret and exact round and bundle identity. Restoring that
  secret and using `recoverable_bundle_policy_v1()` reconstructs the same VAN
  after voting database loss without new authority-root or recovery tables.

## v3.1.0-rc.15

### Fixed

- Persisted helper-share plans can now resume after the authenticated helper
  fleet changes. Plans remain bound to their original planning fleet and
  target, while removed helpers are not contacted and current helpers are
  eligible as fallbacks.

## v3.1.0-rc.14

### Added
- `VotingDb::store_keystone_signatures_batch` now provides atomic, idempotent
  Keystone signature persistence, and `VotingDb::clear_wallet_state` also
  removes the wallet's round-independent PIR cache.
- `RoundPlan` and `RoundPlanView` now expose `immediate_share_confirmed`.
- Added atomic multi-proposal vote batches through
  `commit_atomic_vote_batch`, `prepare_atomic_vote_batch`, and
  `recover_atomic_vote_batch`. `SignedVoteBatch` provides the canonical
  `cast-vote-batch` request, while restart planning and confirmation preserve
  the batch as one recoverable authority chain. Existing batch APIs remain
  singleton compatibility wrappers.
- Added a typed `HelperClient` and host-owned `HelperTransport` for readiness,
  share submission, and status polling. The client validates protocol data,
  bounds requests and responses, applies endpoint-specific retry rules, and
  tracks helper health. `HyperTransport` remains the default direct transport;
  wallets can inject custom, proxy, or Rustls-wrapped Hyper connectors.
- Added `track_pending_shares` for durable confirmation and recovery of pending
  helper shares, plus `confirm_pending_share` for checking one share with the
  same quorum, timeout, cancellation, and health-ordering rules.
- Added the SDK-owned helper delivery lifecycle:
  `HelperClient::preflight_fleet`,
  `CommittedVote::prepare_share_delivery`, and
  `CommittedVote::submit_prepared_shares`. It persists and resumes one
  generation-bound plan for the complete commitment before submitting shares,
  without exposing encrypted helper payloads to the host.

### Changed
- Helper-share planning, persistence, submission, and recovery are now
  authoritative SDK responsibilities. Hosts provide authenticated helper
  configuration, round timing, transport, and cancellation.
- **Breaking:** invalid helper URLs now fail with
  `VotingError::InvalidInput` before network I/O instead of being silently
  dropped. `helper::url::canonicalize_helper_base_url` and
  `canonical_helper_url_list` are public so hosts can validate configuration.
- **Breaking:** initial helper delivery now uses
  `CommittedVote::prepare_share_delivery` followed by
  `CommittedVote::submit_prepared_shares`; the per-share
  `submit_share_to_helpers(ShareSubmissionRequest)` API was removed.
- **Breaking:** `ShareDeliveryPlanningParams` now accepts the authenticated
  round's complete `proposal_ids` roster and derives the immediate share from
  durable ballot intent.
- **Breaking:** encrypted helper payloads and their low-level construction and
  recovery APIs are no longer public. Vote-chain submission continues to use
  the public `VoteCommitmentWire`.
- **Breaking:** helper confirmation polls the complete configured fleet and
  requires agreement from two distinct helpers when at least two are
  configured. Direct confirmation and confirmation-persistence APIs were
  removed in favor of `track_pending_shares` and `confirm_pending_share`.
- **Breaking:** removed `HELPER_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; preflight timing is
  now derived from
  `share_policy::SHARE_HELPER_PREFLIGHT_SOFT_TIMEOUT_MILLISECONDS`.
- `HelperClientConfig` now validates nonzero deadlines and permits at most two
  nonzero retry delays. Confirmation polling is limited to four concurrent
  requests and ten seconds per share.
- Schema versions 16 and 17 persist definite, ambiguous, and interrupted
  delivery outcomes together with complete generation-bound helper plans.
  Legacy rows remain readable but do not weaken placement or quota validation.

### Fixed
- Wallet examples now separate vote-chain submission from helper delivery and
  use the preflight, persisted-plan, and prepared-batch APIs.
- Helper plans remain valid across normal vote confirmation while staying
  bound to the exact vote generation, wallet scope, configured fleet, durable
  VC-tree position, and complete payload set. Stale or inconsistent plans fail
  before network or storage side effects.
- Whole-plan validation now rejects duplicate helpers, fleet drift, invalid
  schedules, target-count drift, and aggregate quota violations before the
  first POST. Concurrent submissions share a process-wide 16-request limit and
  cannot overfill placement targets.
- Helper attempts are journaled before dispatch and retain accepted,
  ambiguous, interrupted, or definite-failure outcomes across cancellation and
  restart. Outcome-unknown POSTs are never retried as definitely unsent;
  overdue recovery uses duplicate-safe reconciliation.
- Recovery preserves durable reveal schedules and placement history, waits for
  vote confirmation, replenishes complete deficits, and rechecks confirmation
  and vote-end state before each POST. Legacy or malformed helper identities
  remain readable without participating in delivery.
- Helper requests now enforce shared deadlines, bounded JSON responses, and
  content types even for custom transports. Boundary completions,
  cancellation, retry backoff, and helper-health scoring no longer lose or
  double-count completed outcomes.
- Nullifier-inconsistent recovery bundles are reported as unrecoverable, and
  delayed network results cannot mutate a replacement share generation.
- SQLite operations that validate durable voting state before updating it now
  use immediate transactions, preventing concurrent WAL writers from causing
  stale-snapshot `database is locked` failures during submission and
  confirmation recording.

## v3.1.0-rc.13

### Changed
- `zcash_voting` now defaults to Zakura and exposes upstream librustzcash
  through the mutually exclusive `lrz` feature while depending directly on
  the leak-free `zakura` or `lrz` complete backend mode from
  `zakura-wallet-lib`. This keeps wallet-family selection in one facade while
  preventing disabled Zakura forks from entering LRZ consumers' Cargo
  lockfiles and metadata. See the "Dependency notes" section of
  `zcash_voting/README.md`.
- Updated the Zakura stack to wallet-libraries RC4 and stable crypto 1.0,
  `voting-crypto-deps 0.2.2`, `voting-circuits 0.11.2`, `imt-tree 0.5.2`,
  `pir-types 0.6.2`, and `pir-client 0.7.2`. This raises the workspace MSRV to
  Rust 1.91.
- Prepared `vote-commitment-tree 0.6.0` and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.8.0` for their Zakura-default feature
  contracts; publish them before `zcash_voting 3.1.0-rc.13`.

## v3.1.0-rc.12

### Added
- Added shared progressive helper timing and initial-delivery limits, plus
  readiness-ranked batch planning that balances a commitment's initial shares
  across the preferred helper pool.
- Added process-local `HelperHealth` scoring that demotes repeatedly failing
  helper servers for fixed cooldown windows, immediately re-demotes them on the
  first failure after expiry, and never removes them from candidate lists.
- Added public helper URL canonicalization for stable server identity. Helper
  base URLs may use HTTP or HTTPS and a mount path, but not credentials, query
  parameters, or fragments; equivalent default ports, trailing slashes, and
  mount-path percent escapes are normalized before comparison or persistence.
- Added a host-owned `HelperTransport` abstraction for helper-server requests.
  The bundled `HyperTransport` provides direct HTTP, while wallets can supply
  Tor or proxy-backed transports without fallback to a different route.

### Changed
- Initial share delivery continues to target half the configured fleet, rounded
  up, while balancing a complete commitment across the ready helper pool.
  Retries may exceed the initial distribution for liveness.

## v3.1.0-rc.11

### Added
- `DelegationKeys::with_round_bound_voting_target` is now public, allowing
  callers to bind a secret-free `RoundBoundVotingHotkeyTarget` directly without
  depending on `WalletDb`, lightwalletd, or
  `prepare_delegation_bundle_for_target`.

### Fixed
- `DelegationKeys::with_round_bound_voting_target` now retains the validated
  public target. Lower-level delegation setup, signing request, and proof APIs
  reject those keys when used with a different stored voting round.

## v3.1.0-rc.10

### Added
- Added deterministic round-level immediate-share selection: share index 0 of
  the lowest voted proposal in the lowest-value eligible bundle is designated
  for immediate helper submission. `RoundPlan` and `RoundPlanView` expose the
  selected `ImmediateShareKey`, while batch submission plans mark the matching
  caller-supplied batch position with `immediate = true` and `submit_at = 0`.

## v3.1.0-rc.9

### Added
- `lwd::anchor_tree_state_with_retry_on` fetches the snapshot note-commitment
  tree on a caller-owned lightwalletd client, so a wallet that already holds a
  channel (Tor, a proxy, a pool) keeps that route instead of the crate dialing
  a second, always-direct connection.
- `precompute_snapshot_bundles` persists the canonical bundle plan for a
  snapshot-stable note set, samples padded-note secrets, and warms PIR for
  real notes plus padded-slot nullifiers. The round must already exist; no
  hotkey or wallet DB is required. Once the wallet is scanned through
  `snapshot_height`, historical note selection is frozen, so first-write-wins
  bundle rows are the intended lock-in rather than a stale-plan hazard.
  Witnesses still come from `prepare_delegation_bundle`. New type:
  `SnapshotBundlePrecomputeReport`.

### Changed
- Voting no longer builds a whole `WalletSummary` just to learn how far the
  wallet has scanned. The sync guards behind `select_notes_with_wallet_db` and
  `prepare_delegation_bundle` now read `block_fully_scanned` — one indexed
  `scan_queue` row plus one `blocks` row — and fall back to
  `birthday_height - 1` exactly as the summary does. Everything else the
  summary computed was discarded: Sapling and Orchard scan-progress estimates
  that scan the full `blocks` table with a correlated subquery per row,
  per-account balances joined across all three shielded pools, and a shard-root
  read per pool. That work grows with the size of the wallet, and it ran on
  every note selection and every delegation. The summary also opened a nested
  transaction, which errors outright if two threads ask at the same time.
- **Behaviour:** when the wallet summary was unavailable — no chain tip
  recorded yet, or scan progress not estimable — the sync guard previously read
  a scanned height of 0 and rejected every nonzero snapshot height. It now
  reads the height actually scanned. Voting needs the snapshot height to be
  covered by the scan; it does not need the wallet to know the chain tip.

### Removed
- **Breaking:** URL-taking lightwalletd helpers that opened their own channel:
  `latest_block_height`, `latest_block_height_with_retry`, `tree_state_bytes`,
  `anchor_tree_state_with_retry`, and `anchor_tree_state_bytes_with_retry`.
  They always dialed a direct connection, which overrode any host-owned route.
  Open a client on the route you want and call `get_latest_block`,
  `get_tree_state`, or `anchor_tree_state_with_retry_on`.

## v3.1.0-rc.8

### Added
- Added a bundle- and round-independent PIR proof cache. `precompute_pir_proofs`
  fetches and persists IMT non-membership proofs for notes that survive the
  caller-supplied `BundlePolicy` (the same plan round setup uses: sub-ballot
  drop and privacy trim) against whatever snapshot the connected PIR server
  currently serves, keyed by `(wallet_id, network, root, nullifier)`, so
  wallets can warm proofs in the background from the selected snapshot set
  before any round is initialized, bundles exist, or a hotkey is generated.
  Padded-slot nullifiers are fetched later on the per-bundle path.
  `validate_cached_pir_proofs` classifies
  cached proofs against an expected round root offline (`Valid` / `StaleRoot`
  / `Missing` / `Invalid`). Snapshots coexist in the cache; leftover roots
  are unused, not harmful. New types: `PirCachePrecomputeResult`,
  `PirCacheValidationReport`, `PirProofCacheEntry`, `PirProofCacheStatus`.

### Changed
- The delegation prove path and `precompute_delegation_pir` now read and write
  the shared `pir_proof_cache` table instead of the bundle-scoped `imt_proofs`
  table, so background-warmed real-note proofs are never refetched at proving
  time; only the per-bundle padded-slot nullifiers can still require a fetch.
  A cached row that fails to decode or verify is treated as a miss and
  overwritten by the refetched proof, so a corrupt row self-heals instead of
  wedging the precompute. Schema version 15 migrates existing `imt_proofs`
  rows into the new cache (keyed by the owning round's network) and drops the
  old table.
- `precompute_pir_proofs` now prunes PIR proof cache rows created more than
  four weeks ago before warming the requested notes. Prove-time cache access
  remains non-pruning so an already cached proof can still complete a bundle.

## v3.1.0-rc.7

### Added
- Added `prepare_commit`, `prepare_commit_batch`, `persist_prepared_commit`,
  and `persist_prepared_commit_batch` so wallets can perform expensive ZKP #2
  proving outside SQLite transactions, then atomically persist the prepared
  result only if its vote-authority, ballot-intent, and current-vote state are
  still unchanged. `prepare_commit_batch` takes a `VoteCommitBatch` for the
  round, drafts, witness, and stage reporter.
- Added `warm_zkp2_proving_cache` for callers that want to initialize the vote
  proving parameters independently of the other proving caches.

## v3.1.0-rc.6

### Changed
- Updated the selectable cryptography facade to `voting-crypto-deps 0.1.2`,
  voting circuits to `0.10.3`, the indexed Merkle tree to `imt-tree 0.4.0`,
  and the PIR stack to `pir-types 0.5.0` and `pir-client 0.6.0`.
- Released `vote-commitment-tree 0.5.2` and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.7.2` with backend-neutral field, group, and
  randomness trait imports for the updated upstream and Zakura dependency
  families.
- Updated the Zakura wallet stack to `zakura-wallet-lib 0.1.0-rc2`,
  `zakura-pczt 0.1.0-rc1`, `zakura-client-backend 0.1.0-rc2`,
  `zakura-client-sqlite 0.1.0-rc2`, and the `zakura-orchard`, `zakura-keys`, and
  `zakura-primitives` `1.0.0-rc.3` crypto family. These releases move the Zakura
  backend to `ff 0.14`, `group 0.14`, and `rand_core 0.10`.
- Routed the remaining test-only randomness imports through the selected backend
  facade (`voting_crypto_deps::rand`) instead of a direct `rand 0.8` dependency, so
  the same tests compile under both the upstream and Zakura families.

## v3.1.0-rc.5

### Added
- `VotingDb::effective_bundle_policy` is now public. A wallet that plans or
  reports outside the `*_for_round` helpers -- because its seed policy is not
  `BundlePolicy::default()` -- previously had no way to resolve a round's
  authoritative policy, and reconstructing the rule from the bundle count alone
  is wrong: a round planned by this binary stores a *trimming* policy, so
  treating "has bundle rows" as "no trim" under-reports withheld value for
  every round that was actually trimmed.
- `minimum_voting_eligibility_and_plan_for_notes` is now public, returning the
  eligibility status together with the `ChunkResult` it came from.
  `minimum_voting_eligibility_for_notes` computes the plan and discards it, so a
  wallet surfacing `PrivacyTrim` next to the eligible weight had to plan a
  second time and repeat the canonical duplicate-nullifier collapse to do it --
  two ways for the two numbers to start describing different note sets.

## v3.1.0-rc.4

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `BundleLayout` reports privacy-trim totals as flat fields
  (`privacy_trim_dropped_bundles`, `privacy_trim_dropped_notes`,
  `privacy_trim_dropped_value_zatoshi`) instead of a nested `PrivacyTrim`.
  Struct literals and JSON consumers must use the new names; absent fields still
  default to zero.
- **Breaking:** removed `privacy_trim` from `SignedDelegationBundle` and
  `SignedDelegationPayloadView`. Trim reporting stays on `BundleLayout` and
  `VotingNoteSelectionResultView` (`ChunkResult` is unchanged).

## v3.1.0-rc.3

### Added
- Accept `static_config_version: 2` static voting configs, which replace v1's
  single `dynamic_config_url` with an ordered `dynamic_config_urls` mirror list.
  `ResolvedStaticVotingConfig` gains `dynamic_config_urls` and
  `static_config_version`; `dynamic_config_url` is retained as the first mirror
  so v1 callers and every existing v1 hash pin keep working unchanged.
- Added `resolve_dynamic_voting_config_from_attempts`, which takes the wallet's
  ordered per-mirror fetch outcomes (`DynamicConfigAttempt`) and returns the
  first that resolves plus the mirrors it passed over
  (`DynamicConfigMirrorFailure`). A mirror is skipped when its fetch failed, its
  bytes did not decode, or its versions are unsupported; one that resolves but
  authenticates no rounds is deprioritized rather than skipped, so a round-less
  resolution is still returned when no mirror carries a verifiable round set.
  When no mirror resolves at all, the new `VotingConfigError::AllMirrorsFailed`
  enumerates every mirror and its reason; a one-mirror list, which is every v1
  static config, reports its own error verbatim instead — including the
  transport cause on a fetch failure, rather than a bare
  "dynamic config fetch failed".
  Falling back widens availability, not trust: every candidate is still
  authenticated against the static trusted keys, and the static hash pin is
  unchanged. Resolving from a non-first mirror emits the new
  `ConfigConditionKind::DynamicMirrorFallbackUsed` condition.
- Added `resolve_dynamic_voting_config_over_mirrors` and
  `DYNAMIC_MIRROR_FETCH_TIMEOUT` (30s): a reference lazy walk that bounds each
  mirror fetch so a blackholed primary cannot leave a healthy later mirror
  unused. The wallet-example and `config_fetcher` transports use it; wallets
  with their own networking should apply an equivalent per-attempt deadline.

### Changed
- `ConfigConditionKind::StaticHashPinVerified` now reports the real outcome. It
  previously reported `status: true` even when the static config source carried
  no `?checksum=sha256:` pin and no verification had run.

## v3.1.0-rc.2

### Added
- Privacy trim in bundle planning: trailing low-value bundles are dropped toward
  `BundlePolicy::max_privacy_bundles` (default 2) to shrink the observable
  delegation-submission count. The count is a target; the discarded value is
  bounded by two hard ceilings, `privacy_drop_bps` (default 1% of selected note
  value) and `max_privacy_drop_zatoshi` (default 1,000 ZEC).
- `PrivacyTrim` on `ChunkResult`, `BundleLayout`, `VotingNoteSelectionResultView`,
  and `SignedDelegationPayloadView`, reporting the raw note value withheld — not
  its bundle-quantized voting weight. Surface it rather than discarding voting
  power silently.
- Round-aware planning helpers that resolve a round's stored policy, so callers
  no longer supply policy internals: `voting_power_for_round`,
  `note_bundles_for_round`, `bundle_notes_for_index_for_round`, and
  `VotingNoteSelectionResultView::from_selected_for_round`.
- In-place upgrades for launched voting databases. Schema changes at or above the
  launch version apply ordered `ALTER` statements and keep persisted round state;
  only pre-launch databases are reset. A reset would have destroyed the randomly
  sampled `van_comm_rand` of any wallet upgrading between submitting a delegation
  and casting its vote, costing that round's weight unrecoverably.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `BundlePolicy::default()` now trims. Opt out with
  `.with_max_privacy_bundles(None)` to keep the previous planning behavior.
- **Breaking:** added `privacy_trim` to `ChunkResult`, `BundleLayout`,
  `SignedDelegationBundle`, `SignedDelegationPayloadView`, and
  `VotingNoteSelectionResultView`. Struct literals must supply it; use
  `PrivacyTrim::default()` when no trim occurred. Serde-backed views still accept
  older payloads with the field absent.
- **Breaking:** `BundlePolicy::with_privacy_drop_bps` returns
  `Result<Self, VotingError>` and rejects budgets above `MAX_PRIVACY_DROP_BPS`.
- The effective `BundlePolicy` is persisted per round and becomes authoritative
  once stored, so an SDK upgrade that changes the defaults cannot invalidate
  bundle rows that were already signed or submitted. Rounds carried across the
  in-place upgrade have no stored policy, so the trim is disabled for any round
  that already holds bundle rows; they keep re-deriving the plan they were signed
  against.

### Removed
- **Breaking:** `VotingNoteSelectionResultView::from_selected` — use
  `from_selected_for_round`, which honors a resumed round's persisted policy.
- **Breaking:** `bundle_notes_for_index` — use `bundle_notes_for_index_for_round`,
  or `bundle_notes_for_index_with_policy` to pass a policy explicitly.

## v3.1.0-rc.1

### Changed
- Updated `zakura-client-backend`, `zakura-client-sqlite`, and
  `zakura-wallet-lib` to their coordinated `0.1.0-rc1` releases.

## v3.1.0-rc.0

### Added
- Added `share::pending_rounds` so wallets can restore unconfirmed helper-share
  tracking with the caller context persisted for each round.
- Extended `zcash_voting` with mutually exclusive `upstream` (default) and
  `zakura` features so the wallet layer can select crates.io librustzcash or the
  Zakura wallet-libraries forks via `zakura-wallet-lib`, in lockstep with the
  vote commitment tree crypto backend.

### Changed
- Replaced temporary Git dependency patches with the published backend-selector
  releases for IMT, PIR, voting circuits, and voting crypto dependencies.
- Released `vote-commitment-tree 0.5.1` and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.7.1`, allowing both crates to select either
  the default upstream voting crypto backend or the mutually exclusive Zakura
  backend.
- Cap each randomized initial helper-share delay at 100 hours while preserving
  the round's last-moment safety window and retry timing from the sampled
  `submit_at`.

## v3.0.0

### Changed
- Released the exact `v3.0.0-rc.4` implementation as `v3.0.0` without
  implementation changes. Its supporting production snapshots were released
  as `pir-types 0.3.0`, `pir-client 0.4.0`, `voting-circuits 0.10.0`,
  `vote-commitment-tree 0.5.0`, and `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.7.0`.

## v3.0.0-rc.4

### Added
- Added a non-default `test-fixtures` feature exposing an atomic vote recovery
  fixture for downstream integration tests that should not build ZKP2.

### Changed
- Aligned the release line on stable `pir-types 0.3.0`, `pir-client 0.4.0`,
  `voting-circuits 0.10.0`, `vote-commitment-tree 0.5.0`, and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.7.0` releases.
- Complete 16-share batch planning now spreads initial targets so that, when
  multiple helpers are configured, no helper is selected for every share.
  Fallback and recovery remain liveness first and may use any available helper.

## v3.0.0-rc.3

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `SharePayload` and `VoteShareWire` now carry the authoritative
  lowercase-hex `vote_round_id` from the vote commitment or recovery bundle.
  Wallets can submit the crate-produced helper-share JSON directly instead of
  injecting round context at the transport boundary.

## v3.0.0-rc.2

### Changed
- **Breaking:** extended the still-prerelease `auth_version: 2` round-auth
  payload to append `pir_layout.poly_len` as a `u32` in little-endian order.
  This binds the YPIR polynomial degree into each round attestation. Any v2
  signatures produced for `v3.0.0-rc.1` used the shorter preimage and must be
  regenerated before wallets adopt this release.
- Updated the PIR client stack to `pir-types 0.3.0-rc.6`,
  `pir-client 0.4.0-rc.7`, and `valar-ypir 0.2.0`. Dynamic voting config
  `pir_layout` now includes `poly_len` (`2048` or `4096`), and PIR connection
  passes the full layout into the server handshake. It fails closed before any
  private query when `/root.pir_layout` or `GET /params/tier1` disagrees.

### Fixed
- Restored negotiated PIR layout support after `v3.0.0-rc.1` inadvertently
  restricted wallets to the current production default. Dynamic config and
  direct PIR connection again accept layouts supported by the shared client
  capability predicate while requiring an exact config/server match before any
  private query. Snapshot tooling and fleet deployment remain responsible for
  advertising only layouts they can materialize, so compatible service layout
  changes do not require a wallet release.

## v3.0.0-rc.1

### Added
- Added secret-free, round-bound voting hotkey targets and a canonical
  delegation capability handoff. A funds controller, such as a custody
  provider, can prepare delegation for a voter's public target, durably store
  the package before broadcasting, verify delivery by its digest, and let the
  voter use the existing confirmation, tree-sync, and ZKP2 voting path without
  sharing account viewing material or the voting hotkey secret. Imported
  capability rounds keep their complete bundle batch atomic and wait for every
  delegation bundle to confirm before creating fresh vote commitments, keeping
  pre-vote package replacement recoverable.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** dynamic voting config round authentication now requires
  `auth_version: 2`. The trusted-key Ed25519 signature covers the canonical
  fixed-width encoding of `RoundAuthPayloadV2`, whose fields encode as
  `"zcash-shielded-vote:round-auth:v2" || round_id (32 raw bytes decoded from
  the rounds-map key) || ea_pk (32 bytes) || pir_depth (u32 LE) ||
  tier0_layers (u32 LE) || tier1_layers (u32 LE)` instead of the bare `ea_pk`.
  This binds each attestation to its round and to the advertised PIR layout, so
  a compromised config host can neither replay a signed `ea_pk` under a
  different round id nor swap the `pir_layout` under attested rounds (a layout
  change requires re-signing every active round).
  `auth_version: 1` entries are no longer authenticated and are reported in
  `skipped_round_ids`; round entries must be re-signed with vote-sdk tooling
  that emits v2 before wallets adopt this release.
- **Breaking:** config resolution and direct PIR connection now accept only the
  deployed 19/12/7 layout currently produced by the production snapshot
  tooling, exposed as `PirLayout::DEPLOYED`. Negotiated geometry is still
  validated first with the shared `pir-types` supported-layout predicate so
  malformed layouts retain detailed validation errors.
- Aligned the prerelease family on `voting-circuits 0.10.0-rc.1`,
  `vote-commitment-tree 0.5.0-rc.1`, and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.7.0-rc.1`.

### Fixed
- Vote commitment tree sync now exposes `SyncLimits` and
  `TreeClient::sync_with_limits`, with defaults of 4,096 pages and five minutes
  per complete sync. The built-in wallet and `vote-tree-cli` transports bound
  each HTTP response to 8 MiB and each request to 60 seconds. Per-round client
  locks prevent a stalled node from blocking tree operations for unrelated
  rounds in the same wallet.

## v2.0.0

### Changed
- Released the exact `v2.0.0-rc.5` implementation as `v2.0.0` without
  implementation changes. Its supporting production snapshots were released
  as `voting-circuits 0.9.0`, `vote-commitment-tree 0.4.0`, and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.6.0`.

## v2.0.0-rc.5

### Fixed
- Keystone signing requests now mark deliberate zero-value hotkey outputs with
  their user-facing address so signer devices display the bundle memo.

## v2.0.0-rc.4

### Changed
- Published `vote-commitment-tree 0.4.0-rc.2` and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.6.0-rc.2` with the workspace's
  `imt-tree 0.2.1` dependency.
- `pir::connect_pir` / `pir::connect_pir_blocking` now take an explicit
  `PirLayout` and fail closed on config/server layout mismatch before any
  private query (`VotingError::InvalidInput`). Clients accept any valid
  two-tier layout matching `/root` rather than a compiled-layout gate.
  `COMPILED_PIR_LAYOUT` is no longer re-exported from `zcash_voting` /
  `prelude`; use resolved config `pir_layout` (tests may still import from
  `pir-types`).
- Dynamic voting config now requires top-level `pir_layout` (`pir_depth`,
  `tier0_layers`, `tier1_layers`). `ResolvedVotingConfig` and its wire exports
  expose it; layout changes are same-chain service updates.
- Delegation submissions now carry compact, versioned Ironwood transaction
  effects so verifiers derive the signing digest directly instead of receiving
  it as a separate field. The payload excludes PCZT signer metadata, and
  synthetic outputs omit account-scoped outgoing viewing metadata. Synthetic
  signing PCZTs also leave their unused V6 anchor and spend witness unset.
- Changed vote-share wire JSON to include only the encrypted share assigned to
  the receiving helper. The `all_enc_shares` field is no longer serialized.

## v2.0.0-rc.3

### Changed
- `NoteInfo::from_orchard_note` now rejects non-Ironwood/V3 notes with
  `VotingError::InvalidInput`. Voting is Ironwood-only, but `NoteInfo` does not
  carry the note version, so an Orchard/V2 note previously passed ingestion and
  bundling and failed only during proof construction — after the governance PCZT
  had been built and signed.
- Updated the published librustzcash dependency requirements to `pczt 0.9.2`,
  `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.7`, `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.7`,
  `zcash_keys 0.16.1`, and `zcash_protocol 0.10.4`. Orchard remains on the
  compatible `0.15` line so downstream workspaces select their own patch release.
- Updated the real delegation proof fixture to use Ironwood/V3 notes and run the
  ignored Halo2 proof tests under the release profile in CI.

## v2.0.0-rc.2

### Changed
- Published the retained-checkpoint vote tree on `shardtree 0.7` as
  `vote-commitment-tree 0.4.0-rc.1`, with the aligned
  `vote-commitment-tree-client 0.6.0-rc.1` release.
- Updated the librustzcash dependency family to published
  `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.4`, `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.4`, and
  `pczt 0.9.1`.

## v2.0.0-rc.1

### Changed
- Updated the librustzcash dependency family to published `zcash_primitives 0.30.0`,
  `zcash_keys 0.16.0`, `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.2`,
  `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.2`, and `pczt 0.8.0`.
- Aligned the Ironwood crate line on `voting-circuits 0.9.0-rc.3`,
  `pir-client 0.4.0-rc.2`, and `pir-types 0.3.0-rc.2`. Wallet integrations
  resolve one shielded/PCZT stack, vote tree storage APIs use `shardtree 0.7`,
  and the wallet crates require Rust 1.88 or newer.
- Updated snapshot selection and governance PCZT construction to use only
  Ironwood/V3 notes. Pre-NU6.3 Orchard/V2 voting is no longer supported on this
  branch, and Ironwood voting no longer requires a custom Rust compile flag.
- Changed public round initialization and delegation APIs to require an explicit
  wallet network, which is persisted with the round state.
- Moved governance PCZT construction behind `VotingDb::build_governance_pczt`,
  which validates branch IDs against the stored round snapshot before writing
  PCZT setup state.

## v1.0.0

### Added
- Added an optional `BundlePolicy` threshold that starts a new bundle when
  adding a note would push the current bundle over the threshold.
- Added shared last-moment round timing helpers in `share_policy` so wallet
  integrations can derive the same helper-share buffer, deadline, and
  `single_share` decision from ceremony start and vote end times.
- Added the public `VOTING_HOTKEY_STORED_SECRET_LEN` constant and updated v2
  hotkey guidance so software and hardware wallets both use app-owned random
  hotkeys instead of deriving software hotkeys from wallet seed material.
- Added crate-owned FRB DTO views in `zcash_voting::wire` for wallet API
  surfaces that previously used local mirrors in `vizor-wallet`:
  `VotingNoteRefView`, `VotingNoteSelectionResultView`, `BundleSetupResultView`,
  `DelegationPirPrecomputeResultView`, `SignedDelegationPayloadView`,
  `KeystoneDelegationRequestView`, `KeystoneSignatureRecordView`, `DraftVoteView`,
  `VanWitnessView`, `SignedVoteCommitmentView`, `SignedVoteCommitmentsView`,
  and `VoteRecordView`.
- Added stable resume-plan wire DTOs in `zcash_voting::wire`
  (`NextStepView`, `RoundPlanView`) so wallet adapters can consume crate-owned
  `session::resume_plan` outputs directly over FRB without maintaining local
  `ApiRoundPlan`/`ApiNextStep` mirrors.
- Added stable recovery/scheduling wire DTOs under `zcash_voting::wire` so wallet
  adapters can share one serde-backed JSON shape for recovery snapshots and
  share submission planning (`ShareSubmissionPlanView`,
  `DelegationRecoveryView`, `VoteRecoveryView`,
  `CommitmentBundleRecoveryView`, `ShareWorkflowRecoveryView`,
  `ShareDelegationRecordView`, and `RoundRecoveryStateView`).
- Added wallet-sidecar and round-context convenience APIs so SDK adapters can
  reuse crate-owned voting DB/session policy instead of local wrappers:
  `VotingDb::wallet_sidecar_path`, `VotingDb::open_wallet_sidecar`,
  `VotingDb::ensure_round_state`, and `delegate::ensure_round_context`
  (`DelegationRoundContext`).
- Extended `session::RoundPlan` with crate-owned recovery/display projection
  fields (`blocking_recovery`, `blocking_share_work`,
  `completed_vote_artifact`, `completed_for_display`, `needs_draft_setup`,
  `primary_action`, `delegation_statuses`, `completed_vote_display`, grouped
  `recovered_delegation_work`, and grouped `recovered_vote_work`) so wallet
  integrations can stop rebuilding foreground-blocking, "voted" display,
  delegation phase, hotkey reuse, vote recovery completeness, delegation
  polling, vote polling, recovered vote submission, and blocking share retry
  decisions from raw recovery snapshots. The same projection is exposed through
  `wire::RoundPlanView` for FFI consumers.
- Added canonical wire JSON types in `zcash_voting::wire`
  (`DelegationSubmissionWire`, `VoteCommitmentWire`, `VoteShareWire`,
  `WireEncryptedShareJson`) so wallets can reuse one source of truth for
  protocol field names, serde renames, and base64/JSON-safe shaping instead of
  reimplementing submission serializers. The wire API now includes
  `VoteShareWire::with_late_bound` for safely applying runtime
  `tree_position`/`submit_at` values while preserving the crate-owned JSON
  integer bounds checks.
- Added a stable `recovery` reporting API so wallets can fetch one typed round
  snapshot from `zcash_voting` instead of reassembling recovery state with
  low-level SQL. New exports include `recovery::round_snapshot`,
  `recovery::recoverable_commitment_bundle`, and `recovery::clear`, plus
  prelude re-exports and a wallet example (`wallet-example::example_recovery`)
  that pairs snapshots with `session::resume_plan`.
- Added `vote::SignedVoteCommitments`, `vote::commit_batch`, and
  `vote::recover_signed_commitments` so wallet SDKs can commit and recover
  per-bundle cast-vote batches through one crate-owned entry point instead of
  reimplementing per-draft loops and recovery wrapping.
- Added atomic idempotent recovery writers on `VotingDb`:
  `mark_delegation_submitted` and `mark_vote_submitted`, including conflict
  checks for tx hashes.
- Added `vote::SignedVoteCommitment` plus
  `CommittedVote::signed_commitment` as the canonical wallet-facing aggregate
  for cast-vote outputs. The API now exposes submission fields, helper-share
  payloads, and persisted recovery JSON through one typed surface with
  fixed-size cryptographic fields (`[u8; 32]` / `[u8; 64]`) to keep byte-length
  guarantees inside the shared crate while still supporting boundary adapters.
- Added `VanWitness::from_wire` to validate and convert wire-friendly witness
  siblings into the typed `[[u8; 32]; 24]` witness form used by vote
  commitment APIs.
- Added `vote::CommittedVote`, a stateful cast-vote handle that mirrors the
  `PreparedDelegationBundle` method flow. Wallet SDKs can now commit/recover a
  vote once, then drive submission and helper-share lifecycle steps through
  methods (`submission`, `share_payloads`, `record_share`, `confirm_share`,
  `add_sent_servers`, `record_submission`, `record_vc_position`) without
  re-threading `(round_id, bundle_index, proposal_id)` across free functions.
- Added `DelegationSigningRequest`, `delegation_signing_request`, and generic
  external delegation signature constructors so wallet SDKs can keep wallet seed
  material outside `zcash_voting`, sign the PCZT sighash locally with the account
  SpendAuth key, and pass only the resulting signature back to the crate.
- Added shared draft vote bounds validation for SDK integrations. The crate now
  exposes proposal and option count bounds plus `vote::validate_draft_vote(s)`,
  and `vote::commit` rejects invalid drafts before proof construction.
  `VotingDb::set_ballot_intent_for_draft_vote` records choice intent through
  the same validated draft surface, and direct ballot-intent writes now require
  the proposal's option count so choices are validated before persistence.
- Added `session::resume_plan` plus a durable `ballot_intent` table (schema v11):
  a pure, I/O-free round-level planner that fuses the per-bundle delegation,
  vote, and share phases with the voter's recorded ballot intent into an ordered
  list of `NextStep`s, so wallet SDKs can resume an interrupted multi-question
  vote without re-deriving recovery state. Exported via the prelude
  (`Decision`, `NextStep`, `RoundPlan`, `resume_plan`). `NextStep` is
  `non_exhaustive`; `CastVote` carries the recorded choice, committed but
  unsubmitted votes resume through `SubmitVote`, and confirmed votes missing
  helper-share rows resume through per-share `SubmitShares` steps derived from
  recovered share payloads. Vote work is ordered by proposal before bundle so
  interrupted multi-bundle questions finish before later questions resume.
  Skipped ballot intents are terminal decisions, `open_proposals` contains only
  proposals with no recorded decision, and choice intents fail fast if no
  eligible bundle rows exist for the round. Intent changes that conflict with an
  already-submitted vote fail before any recovery rows are cleaned up, and stale
  vote submissions are rejected after an intent changes.
- Added `vote::submission` / `vote::recover_commit` guidance for
  `NextStep::SubmitVote` handling. Wallets can reconstruct cast-vote
  submission fields from persisted recovery state without rebuilding from a
  draft, then call `recover_commit` again after confirmation to recover
  helper-share payloads with the confirmed VC position.
- Added `confirmation::*` APIs for wallet SDKs to parse confirmed
  `delegate_vote` and `cast_vote` tx events, then atomically record delegation
  tx hashes, VAN positions, cast-vote tx hashes, and vote commitment tree
  positions without writing workflow SQL locally.
- Added shared delegation request/report types, account-key loading, Keystone
  PCZT redaction, display memo formatting, skipped-suffix bundle validation,
  and bundle weight helpers so wallet SDKs can keep only their runtime-specific
  async/lightwalletd shims.
- Added shared `lwd` helpers for mainnet lightwalletd channel setup, bounded
  unary RPCs, chain-tip lookup, consensus branch resolution, and snapshot
  `TreeState` fetching with retry so wallet SDKs no longer need local copies of
  these queries.
- Added shared wallet note-selection helpers and delegation input gathering
  (`select_snapshot_notes`, `select_snapshot_note_infos`, and
  `gather_delegation_wallet_inputs`) so wallet SDKs can reuse the snapshot
  eligibility, shielded note-info extraction, and selected-note summary logic.
- Added `select_notes_with_wallet_db` and tree-sync-gated `select_notes_with_lwd`
  so wallet SDKs can reuse scan-height validation, wallet/network consistency
  checks, lightwalletd snapshot-anchor fetching, and selected-note assembly
  without carrying SDK-local wrapper logic.
- Added `BundlePolicy`, policy-aware note planning, and policy-aware delegation
  precompute entry points so wallet SDKs can choose how many real notes are
  placed in each bundle while the default fills each bundle up to the circuit
  note-slot count.
- Added library-owned delegation lifecycle stage reporting and branch-id
  provider traits so wallet SDKs can pass progress and consensus-branch
  resolution into `delegate::setup` and `delegate::prove` without duplicating
  library internals.
- Added voting hotkey helpers for app-owned random hotkeys, stored hotkey secret
  reconstruction, raw Orchard delegation-address derivation, and typed
  `DelegationKeys` / `VoteSigner` helpers. New wallet SDKs should generate a
  random hotkey once, store `VotingHotkey::stored_secret()`, and reconstruct a
  typed `VotingHotkey` with `VotingHotkey::from_stored_secret` when needed.
  `generate_random_voting_hotkey` replaces the older raw hotkey generation
  helpers exposed through `hotkey::generate_hotkey` and
  `VotingDb::generate_hotkey`.
- Added `delegate::LightwalletdBranchIdProvider` and
  `delegate::branch_id_for_height` so wallet SDKs can resolve delegation
  consensus branches from a voting snapshot height plus `Network` without
  duplicating consensus activation logic.
- Added `vote::VoteCommitStage` plus `VoteCommitStageReporter` and
  `VoteCommitStageBridge` so wallet SDKs can consume library-owned cast-vote
  lifecycle and proof-progress stages without defining local event enums.
- Added `VotingDb::prepare_delegation_pir` so wallet SDKs can share the
  delegation bundle validation, governance PCZT construction, and PIR precompute
  sequence while still supplying wallet-specific notes, account metadata, typed
  voting hotkey, consensus branch, and PIR transport at their own boundaries.
  Callers that need a non-default bundle policy can use
  `VotingDb::prepare_delegation_pir_with_policy`.
- Added `zcash_voting::witness::generate_note_witnesses` for shielded note
  witness generation from a stored voting round snapshot. The API selects the
  shielded voting protocol from the snapshot height, validates the cached
  lightwalletd `TreeState` height and selected tree root against the persisted
  round parameters, asks the wallet DB for historical Merkle paths, then returns
  `WitnessData` for each bundled note.
- Added `zcash_voting::witness::store_tree_state_and_generate_note_witnesses`
  so wallet SDKs can share the snapshot tree-state persistence, witness
  generation, and bundle witness caching flow while keeping wallet DB opening at
  each SDK boundary.
- Added `VotingDb::has_witnesses` so wallet SDKs can detect already-cached
  bundle witnesses and skip repeat witness generation during precompute resume.
- Added `delegate::prepare_delegation_bundle` with
  `PrepareDelegationBundleParams` and `PreparedDelegationBundle` so wallet SDKs
  can resolve lightwalletd inputs before opening wallet DB handles, then reuse
  plain bundle state across witness precompute, PIR warmup, signing, and
  Keystone flows.
- Added `PreparedDelegationBundle` lifecycle methods and `PreparedSigner` so
  precompute, PCZT setup, proof generation, Keystone signing requests, and
  submission assembly all consume the same prepared bundle state instead of
  re-threading loose round IDs, bundle indexes, note lists, and keys. The
  prepared lifecycle now also owns software-wallet delegation signing for
  callers that choose to pass a seed to the crate, external signature byte
  validation, witness-cache checks, and signed-payload metadata.
- Added `vote::validate_draft_votes` so wallet SDKs can validate canonical
  `DraftVote` inputs through the shared voting API before DB or proof work.
- Added the stable `vote::*` cast-vote API with `DraftVote`, `VanWitness`,
  `VoteCommit`, `VoteSigner`, `VoteSubmission`, and `VoteRecoveryBundle`.
  `vote::commit` now builds ZKP #2, signs the cast-vote payload, persists the
  canonical recovery bundle, and can reconstruct submission fields after a
  process restart.
- Added the stable `share::*` API for helper-share nullifier computation,
  recovery payload reconstruction, share tracking persistence, confirmation,
  sent-server updates, and `share::policy::*` scheduling re-exports.
- Added `VotePhase` and `SharePhase` plus
  `VotingDb::{vote_phase, vote_phases, share_phase, share_phases}` so wallets
  can derive vote/share recovery state without querying SQLite tables directly.
- Added `precompute::{sync_vote_tree, van_witness, reset_vote_tree}` as the
  public vote commitment tree sync and VAN witness surface.
- Added `precompute::reset_voting_session_state` and
  `VotingDb::clear_unsigned_delegation_setup_fields` so wallet integrations can
  recover from interrupted Keystone delegation setup after process restart.
  Round-scoped reset drops process-local vote-tree cache and clears unsigned
  delegation setup columns (`pczt_sighash`, padded-note secrets, and related
  transient fields) while preserving bundles with Keystone signatures or a
  stored `delegation_tx_hash`.
- Added a `zcash_voting::config` voting-service config resolution API
  (`resolve_static_voting_config`, `resolve_dynamic_voting_config`, and
  `decide_config_switch`) so wallets can authenticate static/dynamic config
  bytes with their own transport and classify the resulting config switch.
  `resolve_static_voting_config(source, static_bytes)` authenticates the static
  trust anchor and exposes the `dynamic_config_url` to fetch next;
  `resolve_dynamic_voting_config(resolved_static, dynamic_bytes, options)` then
  authenticates the dynamic config against it. A `wallet-example::example_config`
  module pairs these with a direct-HTTPS `DirectHttpsFetcher` and persists the
  resolved summary used for later switch decisions.
- Added `examples/end_to_end_vote.rs` and README notes for moving from the
  delegation-oriented V2 API to the new vote/share API.

### Changed
- Keystone delegation memo display (`delegate::display_memo`) now puts voting
  power on its own `Amount:` line and truncates only the round name with
  UTF-8-safe byte boundaries when the memo approaches the 512-byte signer limit,
  so hardware-wallet displays no longer clip the trailing ZEC amount. Governance
  PCZT memo bytes now reuse the same formatter.
- `delegate::prepare_delegation_bundle` now takes a typed `VotingHotkey` and
  owns wallet scanned-height lookup. Callers no longer pass hotkey seed bytes
  through delegation preparation.
- Consolidated delegation-bundle preparation into one public
  `delegate::prepare_delegation_bundle` path. `PrepareDelegationBundleParams`
  now carries `DelegationLwdInputs` (`lwd`) and `session_json` directly, while
  `wallet_db` is an explicit function argument instead of being embedded in the
  params struct.
- The default feature set now enables both `pir` and `tree-sync`, so the
  built-in network client surface is available without extra feature flags.
- `zcash_voting::transport::HyperTransport` is now exported unconditionally.
  Callers no longer need to enable `pir`, `tree-sync`, `client-pir`, or
  `client-tree-sync` just to access the transport re-export.
- Split wire DTO definitions from codec/conversion logic: `zcash_voting::wire`
  now owns stable protocol structs only, while serde/base64 conversion helpers
  and JSON-shaping tests moved into crate-private `wire_codec`.
- Moved `VotingRoundParams` ownership to `zcash_voting::wire` as the canonical
  vote-chain payload type, while re-exporting it from `types` for downstream
  compatibility.
- Consolidated wallet-facing recovery orchestration into crate-owned APIs:
  added `phases::WorkflowPhase` with stable resume strings, exposed
  `workflow_phase()` accessors on recovery records, and updated the wallet
  recovery example to load snapshot + `resume_plan` together and recover
  committed-vote payloads directly from planner steps.
- Consolidated recovery snapshot assembly and pending commitment-bundle
  semantics into `zcash_voting`, and reduced the wallet-side adapter boundary
  to FFI shape/phase-string mapping. Added focused unit coverage for pending
  commitment rows, sidecar reopen behavior, and recovery clearing invariants.
- The wallet vote example now includes `commit_vote_bundle_batch`, showing the
  canonical batch cast-vote flow with `vote::commit_batch` and crate-owned
  cancellation/progress adapters.
- Removed crate-side wallet seed APIs from voting hotkey derivation and
  prepared delegation signing. Wallet SDKs now generate app-owned random hotkeys
  and delegation signatures locally, then pass typed `VotingHotkey` values or
  SpendAuth signatures into the crate.
- Removed unused legacy APIs left behind by the wallet integration refactor:
  direct share decomposition/encryption modules, the public share-tracking
  nullifier module, legacy `VotingDb` hotkey helpers, confirmed-state writer
  shims, legacy `Network` numeric converters, and the mainnet-only consensus
  branch ID helper.
- Delegation PIR warmup no longer constructs or caches a governance PCZT.
  `PreparedDelegationBundle::precompute` now warms witnesses, padded-note
  secrets, and PIR rows only; `delegate::setup` builds the PCZT later from the
  persisted padded secrets and refuses to overwrite existing padded secrets or
  `pczt_sighash`. The old loose `PrecomputeDelegationInputs` entry points were
  removed in favor of the prepared-bundle lifecycle.
- Removed the process-local prepared-PCZT cache and its prelude exports now that
  precompute no longer builds PCZT setup material.
- `DelegationKeys::with_hotkey_bytes` no longer accepts `consensus_branch_id`;
  `delegate::setup` now resolves it through a caller-supplied
  `BranchIdProvider`. Delegation proof progress is reported via
  `DelegationStageReporter`, while generic vote proof progress uses
  `ProgressReporter`.
- Vote recovery state is now guarded by durable vote identity. Stale recovery
  JSON, helper-share rows, tx hashes, and vote commitment tree positions cannot
  be attached to a replacement vote after the voter changes intent.
- Helper-share recording now rejects conflicting nullifiers for an existing
  share key in the shared storage layer.
- The raw nullifier-taking helper-share storage writer is now crate-internal.
  Wallet integrations use `share::record`, which derives the nullifier from
  persisted vote recovery state.
- Removed the legacy `VotingDb::mark_vote_submitted`,
  `VotingDb::store_vote_tx_hash`, and `VotingDb::store_commitment_bundle`
  writers, and dropped the stale `votes.submitted` column. Integrations now use
  `vote::commit`, `vote::recover_commit`, `vote::record_submission`, and
  `vote::record_vc_position`.
- `precompute::sync_vote_tree` now rebuilds a round's sparse vote-tree client
  when recovery records a new historical VAN position after an earlier sync,
  so wallets can resume interrupted multi-question votes without manually
  resetting tree state.
- Removed the old `note_bundling` JSON facade and duplicate note-plan schema.
  Smart bundle planning now lives in the slim `note_bundling` module and is
  exposed through the policy-aware `round` APIs. Lower-level public bundle setup
  helpers were removed in favor of `round` module APIs.
- `vote::serialize_recovery` / `vote::parse_recovery` now own the canonical
  `zcash_voting_vote_recovery_v1` recovery JSON format, replacing wallet-owned
  cast-vote recovery blobs.
- `tree_sync::VanWitness` now uses the typed `vote::VanWitness` shape with a
  fixed 24-element authentication path.
- `VotingHotkey` now represents the actual stored hotkey secret plus raw Orchard
  address. The old placeholder Pallas public key and `sv1...` address fields
  were removed.
- `VoteSigner` now accepts only a typed `VotingHotkey`, and
  `vote_commitment::sign_cast_vote_for_account` was removed in favor of the
  canonical voting hotkey account index.
- Raw-byte `DelegationKeys` construction is no longer public. Wallet callers use
  `DelegationKeys::with_voting_hotkey`, and the crate derives network-specific
  metadata from the `VotingHotkey`.
- Low-level ZKP2 and cast-vote signing helpers that take raw hotkey seed plus
  `network_id` are now crate-internal. Wallet callers should use `vote::commit`
  with `VoteSigner`.
- The wallet delegation example now separates reusable bundle preparation from
  PIR precompute, software signing, and Keystone request/submission helpers so resume
  flows can share cached bundle state without repeating lightwalletd and wallet
  note-selection work.
- `delegate::redact_for_signer` is no longer exported as a generic wallet-facing
  helper. Delegation Keystone requests still redact their PCZT internally;
  generic wallet send PCZT redaction belongs in the wallet SDK boundary.

# 0.11.0

## Changed
- Bumped `zcash_voting` to `0.11.0`, `vote-commitment-tree` to `0.3.2`,
  and `vote-commitment-tree-client` to `0.5.2`.
- Bumped the Orchard dependency line to `orchard 0.14`,
  `halo2_gadgets =0.5.0`, `pczt 0.7`, `zcash_keys 0.14`,
  `zcash_primitives 0.28`, and `zcash_protocol 0.9`.
- Bumped the circuit and nullifier dependencies to published
  `voting-circuits 0.8.0`, `imt-tree 0.2.0`, `pir-types 0.2.0`, and
  `pir-client 0.3.0`.

# 0.10.2

## Security
- Bumped `voting-circuits` to `0.7.0`, which rejects Halo2 proofs that verify
  but leave trailing unread transcript bytes.

# 0.10.1

## Security
- Exact-pinned the Valar-owned voting dependency surface and related PIR/tree
  transitives used by the client features. `zcash_voting` now directly
  constrains `pir-client`, `pir-types`, `valar-spiral-rs`, `valar-ypir`,
  `imt-tree`, `voting-circuits`, `vote-commitment-tree`, and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client`.
- Bumped `vote-commitment-tree` to `0.3.1` and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client` to `0.5.1` for publishable manifest-only pin
  releases.

## Notes
- This is a supply-chain pin tightening release with no functional code
  changes.
- Scope is intentionally limited to the Valar-owned runtime voting dependency
  surface and its PIR/tree transitives. Upstream and dev-only dependency
  movement should be handled through lockfile review/CI policy rather than this
  manifest-only pinning release.

# 0.10.0

## Changed
- Bumped `voting-circuits` to `0.6.0` and removed the workspace patch override,
  so the SDK uses the published circuit crate for delegation proof generation.
- Updated wallet-side governance derivations to call the circuit crate's
  canonical helpers for nullifier domains, governance nullifiers, VAN
  commitments, and rho bindings. This is a breaking cryptographic derivation
  change for delegation proof compatibility.

# 0.9.2

## Fixed
- Matched wallet-side padded note commitments and nullifiers to the synthetic
  padding points introduced by `voting-circuits 0.5.0`, so delegation PIR
  precompute fetches the same padded IMT proofs that proof generation later
  requests.

# 0.9.1

## Added
- Added pure `share_policy`, `pir_snapshot`, and `note_bundling` APIs so wallet
  SDKs can share helper-share timing, exact PIR snapshot selection, and note
  bundle planning logic instead of reimplementing it in each app.

# 0.9.0

## Changed
- Bumped `voting-circuits` to `0.5.0` and updated callers to use its public
  re-exports and upstream circuit key caches.
- Bumped `vote-commitment-tree` to `0.3.0` and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client` to `0.5.0`.
- Removed local wallet-side test/helpers that duplicated vote-commitment and
  El Gamal internals now owned by `voting-circuits`.

# 0.8.1

## Fixed
- Recovery store operations now fail when their target bundle or vote row is
  missing instead of treating a zero-row SQLite update as success.

# 0.8.0

## Changed
- Reset the pre-launch SQLite schema history. Voting databases from interim
  schema versions are now recreated from the current `001_init.sql` baseline
  and marked as schema version 9.

# 0.7.1

## Added
- Added `NoteInfo::from_orchard_note` so SDK FFI layers can reuse the crate's
  Orchard note conversion logic instead of reconstructing `NoteInfo` fields
  themselves.

# 0.7.0

## Changed
- Removed the unused `round_id` parameter from `VotingDb::generate_hotkey`.

## Fixed
- Share payload construction now errors when the requested share is missing its
  blind instead of using empty bytes.
- Recovery now rejects stored commitment bundles that are missing their vote
  commitment tree position instead of assuming position 0.
- Delegation proof generation now requires the randomness saved when the PCZT was
  built instead of sampling fresh randomness when those fields are empty.

# 0.6.0

## Changed
- Bumped `zcash_voting` to `0.6.0`, `vote-commitment-tree` to `0.2.0`, and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client` to `0.4.0` for the breaking commitment leaf
  pagination API.
- Vote commitment tree sync now consumes paginated commitment leaf responses
  with per-block roots instead of issuing one request per height window.

# 0.5.12

## Fixed
- `zcash_voting::action::build_governance_pczt` now guarantees the returned
  `GovernancePczt` describes a single Orchard action: the spend producing
  `nf_signed`, `rk`, and `alpha` is the same action whose output produces
  `cmx_new` and `rseed_output`. The Orchard PCZT builder pads to two actions
  and shuffles spends and outputs independently, so previous calls could
  return metadata mixing two different randomized actions, which later caused
  `build_and_prove_delegation` to fail with `delegation proof result cmx_new
  does not match stored PCZT data`. The construction tail now retries
  `Builder::build_for_pczt` until `spend_idx == output_idx`, fails before
  persistence if no paired layout appears, and re-validates the serialized
  PCZT against the returned `action_index`.

# 0.5.10

## Changed
- Bumped `zcash_voting` to `0.5.10` and updated `voting-circuits` to `0.4.2`.

# 0.5.9

## Added
- Added `VotingDb::has_round` for checking round existence through the storage
  API without downstream callers depending on SQLite schema details.

# 0.5.8

## Added
- `VotingDb::setup_bundles` now persists bundle note identity hashes, and
  `VotingDb::build_governance_pczt`, `VotingDb::precompute_delegation_pir`,
  and `VotingDb::build_and_prove_delegation` reject same-position note
  substitutions for bundles set up under 0.5.8 or later. Bundles persisted by
  earlier releases retain the prior position-only check until they are
  re-setup.

## Fixed
- Delegation proof storage now checks proof-derived public inputs against the
  PCZT-derived values stored during `VotingDb::build_governance_pczt`, and
  stores the proof, public inputs, and round phase atomically.
- `VotingDb::setup_bundles` now persists all bundle rows in a single
  transaction.
- Avoided dropping the Hyper/Tokio transport runtime from inside an active Tokio
  context.

# 0.5.7

## Fixed
- `VotingDb::mark_vote_submitted` now returns an error when no persisted vote
  row matches the requested round, wallet, bundle, and proposal instead of
  treating a zero-row update as success.

# 0.5.6

## Added
- Added a `test-fixtures` feature exposing `VotingDb::insert_vote_fixture`, so
  downstream FFI tests can create vote rows through `VotingDb` instead of
  depending on SQLite schema internals.

# 0.5.5

## Fixed
- Keystone delegation submissions now reject a supplied sighash unless it matches
  the PCZT sighash stored for the bundle.

# 0.5.4

## Fixed
- Delegation submission signing now derives the sender spending key from the
  caller's ZIP-32 `account_index` instead of always using account 0.

# 0.5.3

## Fixed
- **`zcash_voting` `network_id` convention** now matches the wallet SDK everywhere
  (`zkp1::build_and_prove_delegation`, PIR `precompute_delegation_pir` padded
  nullifiers, `zkp2::derive_spending_key`, `vote_commitment::sign_cast_vote`, and
  storage helpers that take `network_id`): **0 = testnet, 1 = mainnet**. The
  padded-nullifier path had previously used the inverse mapping, so `NoteInfo`
  from the SDK could disagree with PIR precompute vs proof generation.

## Changed
- Bumped the `zcash_voting` crate version to `0.5.3`. Direct callers who flipped
  `network_id` to compensate for the old bug should pass the SDK value unchanged
  after upgrading.

# 0.5.2

## Changed
- Reissued the tree-sync transport release from the merged `main` history.
- Confirmed the Hyper/Rustls tree-sync transport against production vote-chain
  endpoints for non-empty rounds.

# 0.5.1

## Changed
- Moved vote commitment tree sync onto the injected transport boundary and
  provided a direct Hyper/Rustls transport from `zcash_voting`.
- Removed `reqwest` from `vote-commitment-tree-client`'s library path.

# 0.5.0

## Changed
- Made `client-pir` transport-agnostic. `zcash_voting` no longer pulls
  `reqwest`; callers must provide a `pir_client::Transport`.
- Added transport-aware PIR precompute/proving entry points so SDKs can provide
  their own HTTP stack.
- Consolidated PIR proof validation and client transport under the single
  `client-pir` feature.
- Added a direct Hyper/Rustls PIR transport under `client-pir` for consumers
  that do not provide their own transport.

# 0.4.1

## Added
- Split the `zcash_voting` network-facing `client` feature into granular
  `client-pir` and `client-tree-sync` features. The existing `client` feature
  remains as a backwards-compatible aggregate of both.
- Made the PIR proof conversion/validation helper available to downstream
  consumers so SDK FFI layers can validate PIR `ImtProofData` without
  enabling vote-commitment-tree sync.

## Changed
- Bumped the `zcash_voting` crate version to `0.4.1` for the additive feature
  split.

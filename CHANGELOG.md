# Changelog
All notable changes to this workspace will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this workspace adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

# Unreleased

## Changed
- Aligned the Ironwood crate line on `voting-circuits 0.9.0-rc.2`,
  `pir-client 0.4.0-rc.2`, `pir-types 0.3.0-rc.2`, and a pinned librustzcash
  revision containing Ironwood historical note selection. Wallet integrations
  resolve one shielded/PCZT stack, vote tree storage APIs use `shardtree 0.7`,
  and the wallet crates require Rust 1.88 or newer.
- Updated snapshot selection and governance PCZT construction to use only
  Ironwood/V3 notes. Pre-NU6.3 Orchard/V2 voting is no longer supported on this
  branch.
- Persisted each voting round's wallet network and validate governance PCZT
  branch IDs against the stored round snapshot before writing PCZT setup state.
- Expressed the librustzcash revision pin as a `[patch.crates-io]` stanza with
  plain crates.io version requirements, rather than inline `git`/`rev` on each
  workspace dependency. Building this workspace directly is unaffected, but a
  downstream consumer can now redirect the whole librustzcash stack to a
  revision of its choosing via its own `[patch.crates-io]`.

## v1.0.0

### Added
- Added an optional `BundlePolicy` threshold that starts a new bundle when
  adding a note would push the current bundle over the threshold.
- Added shared last-moment round timing helpers in `share_policy` so wallet
  integrations can derive the same helper-share buffer, deadline, and
  `single_share` decision from ceremony start and vote end times.
- Added the public `VOTING_HOTKEY_STORED_SECRET_LEN` constant and updated v2
  hotkey guidance so software and hardware wallets both use app-owned random
  hotkeys instead of deriving software hotkeys from wallet seed material.
- Added crate-owned FRB DTO views in `zcash_voting::wire` for wallet API
  surfaces that previously used local mirrors in `vizor-wallet`:
  `VotingNoteRefView`, `VotingNoteSelectionResultView`, `BundleSetupResultView`,
  `DelegationPirPrecomputeResultView`, `SignedDelegationPayloadView`,
  `KeystoneDelegationRequestView`, `KeystoneSignatureRecordView`, `DraftVoteView`,
  `VanWitnessView`, `SignedVoteCommitmentView`, `SignedVoteCommitmentsView`,
  and `VoteRecordView`.
- Added stable resume-plan wire DTOs in `zcash_voting::wire`
  (`NextStepView`, `RoundPlanView`) so wallet adapters can consume crate-owned
  `session::resume_plan` outputs directly over FRB without maintaining local
  `ApiRoundPlan`/`ApiNextStep` mirrors.
- Added stable recovery/scheduling wire DTOs under `zcash_voting::wire` so wallet
  adapters can share one serde-backed JSON shape for recovery snapshots and
  share submission planning (`ShareSubmissionPlanView`,
  `DelegationRecoveryView`, `VoteRecoveryView`,
  `CommitmentBundleRecoveryView`, `ShareWorkflowRecoveryView`,
  `ShareDelegationRecordView`, and `RoundRecoveryStateView`).
- Added wallet-sidecar and round-context convenience APIs so SDK adapters can
  reuse crate-owned voting DB/session policy instead of local wrappers:
  `VotingDb::wallet_sidecar_path`, `VotingDb::open_wallet_sidecar`,
  `VotingDb::ensure_round_state`, and `delegate::ensure_round_context`
  (`DelegationRoundContext`).
- Extended `session::RoundPlan` with crate-owned recovery/display projection
  fields (`blocking_recovery`, `blocking_share_work`,
  `completed_vote_artifact`, `completed_for_display`, `needs_draft_setup`,
  `primary_action`, `delegation_statuses`, `completed_vote_display`, grouped
  `recovered_delegation_work`, and grouped `recovered_vote_work`) so wallet
  integrations can stop rebuilding foreground-blocking, "voted" display,
  delegation phase, hotkey reuse, vote recovery completeness, delegation
  polling, vote polling, recovered vote submission, and blocking share retry
  decisions from raw recovery snapshots. The same projection is exposed through
  `wire::RoundPlanView` for FFI consumers.
- Added canonical wire JSON types in `zcash_voting::wire`
  (`DelegationSubmissionWire`, `VoteCommitmentWire`, `VoteShareWire`,
  `WireEncryptedShareJson`) so wallets can reuse one source of truth for
  protocol field names, serde renames, and base64/JSON-safe shaping instead of
  reimplementing submission serializers. The wire API now includes
  `VoteShareWire::with_late_bound` for safely applying runtime
  `tree_position`/`submit_at` values while preserving the crate-owned JSON
  integer bounds checks.
- Added a stable `recovery` reporting API so wallets can fetch one typed round
  snapshot from `zcash_voting` instead of reassembling recovery state with
  low-level SQL. New exports include `recovery::round_snapshot`,
  `recovery::recoverable_commitment_bundle`, and `recovery::clear`, plus
  prelude re-exports and a wallet example (`wallet-example::example_recovery`)
  that pairs snapshots with `session::resume_plan`.
- Added `vote::SignedVoteCommitments`, `vote::commit_batch`, and
  `vote::recover_signed_commitments` so wallet SDKs can commit and recover
  per-bundle cast-vote batches through one crate-owned entry point instead of
  reimplementing per-draft loops and recovery wrapping.
- Added atomic idempotent recovery writers on `VotingDb`:
  `mark_delegation_submitted` and `mark_vote_submitted`, including conflict
  checks for tx hashes.
- Added `vote::SignedVoteCommitment` plus
  `CommittedVote::signed_commitment` as the canonical wallet-facing aggregate
  for cast-vote outputs. The API now exposes submission fields, helper-share
  payloads, and persisted recovery JSON through one typed surface with
  fixed-size cryptographic fields (`[u8; 32]` / `[u8; 64]`) to keep byte-length
  guarantees inside the shared crate while still supporting boundary adapters.
- Added `VanWitness::from_wire` to validate and convert wire-friendly witness
  siblings into the typed `[[u8; 32]; 24]` witness form used by vote
  commitment APIs.
- Added `vote::CommittedVote`, a stateful cast-vote handle that mirrors the
  `PreparedDelegationBundle` method flow. Wallet SDKs can now commit/recover a
  vote once, then drive submission and helper-share lifecycle steps through
  methods (`submission`, `share_payloads`, `record_share`, `confirm_share`,
  `add_sent_servers`, `record_submission`, `record_vc_position`) without
  re-threading `(round_id, bundle_index, proposal_id)` across free functions.
- Added `DelegationSigningRequest`, `delegation_signing_request`, and generic
  external delegation signature constructors so wallet SDKs can keep wallet seed
  material outside `zcash_voting`, sign the PCZT sighash locally with the account
  SpendAuth key, and pass only the resulting signature back to the crate.
- Added shared draft vote bounds validation for SDK integrations. The crate now
  exposes proposal and option count bounds plus `vote::validate_draft_vote(s)`,
  and `vote::commit` rejects invalid drafts before proof construction.
  `VotingDb::set_ballot_intent_for_draft_vote` records choice intent through
  the same validated draft surface, and direct ballot-intent writes now require
  the proposal's option count so choices are validated before persistence.
- Added `session::resume_plan` plus a durable `ballot_intent` table (schema v11):
  a pure, I/O-free round-level planner that fuses the per-bundle delegation,
  vote, and share phases with the voter's recorded ballot intent into an ordered
  list of `NextStep`s, so wallet SDKs can resume an interrupted multi-question
  vote without re-deriving recovery state. Exported via the prelude
  (`Decision`, `NextStep`, `RoundPlan`, `resume_plan`). `NextStep` is
  `non_exhaustive`; `CastVote` carries the recorded choice, committed but
  unsubmitted votes resume through `SubmitVote`, and confirmed votes missing
  helper-share rows resume through per-share `SubmitShares` steps derived from
  recovered share payloads. Vote work is ordered by proposal before bundle so
  interrupted multi-bundle questions finish before later questions resume.
  Skipped ballot intents are terminal decisions, `open_proposals` contains only
  proposals with no recorded decision, and choice intents fail fast if no
  eligible bundle rows exist for the round. Intent changes that conflict with an
  already-submitted vote fail before any recovery rows are cleaned up, and stale
  vote submissions are rejected after an intent changes.
- Added `vote::submission` / `vote::recover_commit` guidance for
  `NextStep::SubmitVote` handling. Wallets can reconstruct cast-vote
  submission fields from persisted recovery state without rebuilding from a
  draft, then call `recover_commit` again after confirmation to recover
  helper-share payloads with the confirmed VC position.
- Added `confirmation::*` APIs for wallet SDKs to parse confirmed
  `delegate_vote` and `cast_vote` tx events, then atomically record delegation
  tx hashes, VAN positions, cast-vote tx hashes, and vote commitment tree
  positions without writing workflow SQL locally.
- Added shared delegation request/report types, account-key loading, Keystone
  PCZT redaction, display memo formatting, skipped-suffix bundle validation,
  and bundle weight helpers so wallet SDKs can keep only their runtime-specific
  async/lightwalletd shims.
- Added shared `lwd` helpers for mainnet lightwalletd channel setup, bounded
  unary RPCs, chain-tip lookup, consensus branch resolution, and snapshot
  `TreeState` fetching with retry so wallet SDKs no longer need local copies of
  these queries.
- Added shared wallet note-selection helpers and delegation input gathering
  (`select_snapshot_notes`, `select_snapshot_note_infos`, and
  `gather_delegation_wallet_inputs`) so wallet SDKs can reuse the snapshot
  eligibility, shielded note-info extraction, and selected-note summary logic.
- Added `select_notes_with_wallet_db` and tree-sync-gated `select_notes_with_lwd`
  so wallet SDKs can reuse scan-height validation, wallet/network consistency
  checks, lightwalletd snapshot-anchor fetching, and selected-note assembly
  without carrying SDK-local wrapper logic.
- Added `BundlePolicy`, policy-aware note planning, and policy-aware delegation
  precompute entry points so wallet SDKs can choose how many real notes are
  placed in each bundle while the default fills each bundle up to the circuit
  note-slot count.
- Added library-owned delegation lifecycle stage reporting and branch-id
  provider traits so wallet SDKs can pass progress and consensus-branch
  resolution into `delegate::setup` and `delegate::prove` without duplicating
  library internals.
- Added voting hotkey helpers for app-owned random hotkeys, stored hotkey secret
  reconstruction, raw Orchard delegation-address derivation, and typed
  `DelegationKeys` / `VoteSigner` helpers. New wallet SDKs should generate a
  random hotkey once, store `VotingHotkey::stored_secret()`, and reconstruct a
  typed `VotingHotkey` with `VotingHotkey::from_stored_secret` when needed.
  `generate_random_voting_hotkey` replaces the older raw hotkey generation
  helpers exposed through `hotkey::generate_hotkey` and
  `VotingDb::generate_hotkey`.
- Added `delegate::LightwalletdBranchIdProvider` and
  `delegate::branch_id_for_height` so wallet SDKs can resolve delegation
  consensus branches from a voting snapshot height plus `Network` without
  duplicating consensus activation logic.
- Added `vote::VoteCommitStage` plus `VoteCommitStageReporter` and
  `VoteCommitStageBridge` so wallet SDKs can consume library-owned cast-vote
  lifecycle and proof-progress stages without defining local event enums.
- Added `VotingDb::prepare_delegation_pir` so wallet SDKs can share the
  delegation bundle validation, governance PCZT construction, and PIR precompute
  sequence while still supplying wallet-specific notes, account metadata, typed
  voting hotkey, consensus branch, and PIR transport at their own boundaries.
  Callers that need a non-default bundle policy can use
  `VotingDb::prepare_delegation_pir_with_policy`.
- Added `zcash_voting::witness::generate_note_witnesses` for shielded note
  witness generation from a stored voting round snapshot. The API selects the
  shielded voting protocol from the snapshot height, validates the cached
  lightwalletd `TreeState` height and selected tree root against the persisted
  round parameters, asks the wallet DB for historical Merkle paths, then returns
  `WitnessData` for each bundled note.
- Added `zcash_voting::witness::store_tree_state_and_generate_note_witnesses`
  so wallet SDKs can share the snapshot tree-state persistence, witness
  generation, and bundle witness caching flow while keeping wallet DB opening at
  each SDK boundary.
- Added `VotingDb::has_witnesses` so wallet SDKs can detect already-cached
  bundle witnesses and skip repeat witness generation during precompute resume.
- Added `delegate::prepare_delegation_bundle` with
  `PrepareDelegationBundleParams` and `PreparedDelegationBundle` so wallet SDKs
  can resolve lightwalletd inputs before opening wallet DB handles, then reuse
  plain bundle state across witness precompute, PIR warmup, signing, and
  Keystone flows.
- Added `PreparedDelegationBundle` lifecycle methods and `PreparedSigner` so
  precompute, PCZT setup, proof generation, Keystone signing requests, and
  submission assembly all consume the same prepared bundle state instead of
  re-threading loose round IDs, bundle indexes, note lists, and keys. The
  prepared lifecycle now also owns software-wallet delegation signing for
  callers that choose to pass a seed to the crate, external signature byte
  validation, witness-cache checks, and signed-payload metadata.
- Added `vote::validate_draft_votes` so wallet SDKs can validate canonical
  `DraftVote` inputs through the shared voting API before DB or proof work.
- Added the stable `vote::*` cast-vote API with `DraftVote`, `VanWitness`,
  `VoteCommit`, `VoteSigner`, `VoteSubmission`, and `VoteRecoveryBundle`.
  `vote::commit` now builds ZKP #2, signs the cast-vote payload, persists the
  canonical recovery bundle, and can reconstruct submission fields after a
  process restart.
- Added the stable `share::*` API for helper-share nullifier computation,
  recovery payload reconstruction, share tracking persistence, confirmation,
  sent-server updates, and `share::policy::*` scheduling re-exports.
- Added `VotePhase` and `SharePhase` plus
  `VotingDb::{vote_phase, vote_phases, share_phase, share_phases}` so wallets
  can derive vote/share recovery state without querying SQLite tables directly.
- Added `precompute::{sync_vote_tree, van_witness, reset_vote_tree}` as the
  public vote commitment tree sync and VAN witness surface.
- Added `precompute::reset_voting_session_state` and
  `VotingDb::clear_unsigned_delegation_setup_fields` so wallet integrations can
  recover from interrupted Keystone delegation setup after process restart.
  Round-scoped reset drops process-local vote-tree cache and clears unsigned
  delegation setup columns (`pczt_sighash`, padded-note secrets, and related
  transient fields) while preserving bundles with Keystone signatures or a
  stored `delegation_tx_hash`.
- Added a `zcash_voting::config` voting-service config resolution API
  (`resolve_static_voting_config`, `resolve_dynamic_voting_config`, and
  `decide_config_switch`) so wallets can authenticate static/dynamic config
  bytes with their own transport and classify the resulting config switch.
  `resolve_static_voting_config(source, static_bytes)` authenticates the static
  trust anchor and exposes the `dynamic_config_url` to fetch next;
  `resolve_dynamic_voting_config(resolved_static, dynamic_bytes, options)` then
  authenticates the dynamic config against it. A `wallet-example::example_config`
  module pairs these with a direct-HTTPS `DirectHttpsFetcher` and persists the
  resolved summary used for later switch decisions.
- Added `examples/end_to_end_vote.rs` and README notes for moving from the
  delegation-oriented V2 API to the new vote/share API.

### Changed
- Keystone delegation memo display (`delegate::display_memo`) now puts voting
  power on its own `Amount:` line and truncates only the round name with
  UTF-8-safe byte boundaries when the memo approaches the 512-byte signer limit,
  so hardware-wallet displays no longer clip the trailing ZEC amount. Governance
  PCZT memo bytes now reuse the same formatter.
- `delegate::prepare_delegation_bundle` now takes a typed `VotingHotkey` and
  owns wallet scanned-height lookup. Callers no longer pass hotkey seed bytes
  through delegation preparation.
- Consolidated delegation-bundle preparation into one public
  `delegate::prepare_delegation_bundle` path. `PrepareDelegationBundleParams`
  now carries `DelegationLwdInputs` (`lwd`) and `session_json` directly, while
  `wallet_db` is an explicit function argument instead of being embedded in the
  params struct.
- The default feature set now enables both `pir` and `tree-sync`, so the
  built-in network client surface is available without extra feature flags.
- `zcash_voting::transport::HyperTransport` is now exported unconditionally.
  Callers no longer need to enable `pir`, `tree-sync`, `client-pir`, or
  `client-tree-sync` just to access the transport re-export.
- Split wire DTO definitions from codec/conversion logic: `zcash_voting::wire`
  now owns stable protocol structs only, while serde/base64 conversion helpers
  and JSON-shaping tests moved into crate-private `wire_codec`.
- Moved `VotingRoundParams` ownership to `zcash_voting::wire` as the canonical
  vote-chain payload type, while re-exporting it from `types` for downstream
  compatibility.
- Consolidated wallet-facing recovery orchestration into crate-owned APIs:
  added `phases::WorkflowPhase` with stable resume strings, exposed
  `workflow_phase()` accessors on recovery records, and updated the wallet
  recovery example to load snapshot + `resume_plan` together and recover
  committed-vote payloads directly from planner steps.
- Consolidated recovery snapshot assembly and pending commitment-bundle
  semantics into `zcash_voting`, and reduced the wallet-side adapter boundary
  to FFI shape/phase-string mapping. Added focused unit coverage for pending
  commitment rows, sidecar reopen behavior, and recovery clearing invariants.
- The wallet vote example now includes `commit_vote_bundle_batch`, showing the
  canonical batch cast-vote flow with `vote::commit_batch` and crate-owned
  cancellation/progress adapters.
- Removed crate-side wallet seed APIs from voting hotkey derivation and
  prepared delegation signing. Wallet SDKs now generate app-owned random hotkeys
  and delegation signatures locally, then pass typed `VotingHotkey` values or
  SpendAuth signatures into the crate.
- Removed unused legacy APIs left behind by the wallet integration refactor:
  direct share decomposition/encryption modules, the public share-tracking
  nullifier module, legacy `VotingDb` hotkey helpers, confirmed-state writer
  shims, legacy `Network` numeric converters, and the mainnet-only consensus
  branch ID helper.
- Delegation PIR warmup no longer constructs or caches a governance PCZT.
  `PreparedDelegationBundle::precompute` now warms witnesses, padded-note
  secrets, and PIR rows only; `delegate::setup` builds the PCZT later from the
  persisted padded secrets and refuses to overwrite existing padded secrets or
  `pczt_sighash`. The old loose `PrecomputeDelegationInputs` entry points were
  removed in favor of the prepared-bundle lifecycle.
- Removed the process-local prepared-PCZT cache and its prelude exports now that
  precompute no longer builds PCZT setup material.
- `DelegationKeys::with_hotkey_bytes` no longer accepts `consensus_branch_id`;
  `delegate::setup` now resolves it through a caller-supplied
  `BranchIdProvider`. Delegation proof progress is reported via
  `DelegationStageReporter`, while generic vote proof progress uses
  `ProgressReporter`.
- Vote recovery state is now guarded by durable vote identity. Stale recovery
  JSON, helper-share rows, tx hashes, and vote commitment tree positions cannot
  be attached to a replacement vote after the voter changes intent.
- Helper-share recording now rejects conflicting nullifiers for an existing
  share key in the shared storage layer.
- The raw nullifier-taking helper-share storage writer is now crate-internal.
  Wallet integrations use `share::record`, which derives the nullifier from
  persisted vote recovery state.
- Removed the legacy `VotingDb::mark_vote_submitted`,
  `VotingDb::store_vote_tx_hash`, and `VotingDb::store_commitment_bundle`
  writers, and dropped the stale `votes.submitted` column. Integrations now use
  `vote::commit`, `vote::recover_commit`, `vote::record_submission`, and
  `vote::record_vc_position`.
- `precompute::sync_vote_tree` now rebuilds a round's sparse vote-tree client
  when recovery records a new historical VAN position after an earlier sync,
  so wallets can resume interrupted multi-question votes without manually
  resetting tree state.
- Removed the old `note_bundling` JSON facade and duplicate note-plan schema.
  Smart bundle planning now lives in the slim `note_bundling` module and is
  exposed through the policy-aware `round` APIs. Lower-level public bundle setup
  helpers were removed in favor of `round` module APIs.
- `vote::serialize_recovery` / `vote::parse_recovery` now own the canonical
  `zcash_voting_vote_recovery_v1` recovery JSON format, replacing wallet-owned
  cast-vote recovery blobs.
- `tree_sync::VanWitness` now uses the typed `vote::VanWitness` shape with a
  fixed 24-element authentication path.
- `VotingHotkey` now represents the actual stored hotkey secret plus raw Orchard
  address. The old placeholder Pallas public key and `sv1...` address fields
  were removed.
- `VoteSigner` now accepts only a typed `VotingHotkey`, and
  `vote_commitment::sign_cast_vote_for_account` was removed in favor of the
  canonical voting hotkey account index.
- Raw-byte `DelegationKeys` construction is no longer public. Wallet callers use
  `DelegationKeys::with_voting_hotkey`, and the crate derives network-specific
  metadata from the `VotingHotkey`.
- Low-level ZKP2 and cast-vote signing helpers that take raw hotkey seed plus
  `network_id` are now crate-internal. Wallet callers should use `vote::commit`
  with `VoteSigner`.
- The wallet delegation example now separates reusable bundle preparation from
  PIR precompute, software signing, and Keystone request/submission helpers so resume
  flows can share cached bundle state without repeating lightwalletd and wallet
  note-selection work.
- `delegate::redact_for_signer` is no longer exported as a generic wallet-facing
  helper. Delegation Keystone requests still redact their PCZT internally;
  generic wallet send PCZT redaction belongs in the wallet SDK boundary.

# 0.11.0

## Changed
- Bumped `zcash_voting` to `0.11.0`, `vote-commitment-tree` to `0.3.2`,
  and `vote-commitment-tree-client` to `0.5.2`.
- Bumped the Orchard dependency line to `orchard 0.14`,
  `halo2_gadgets =0.5.0`, `pczt 0.7`, `zcash_keys 0.14`,
  `zcash_primitives 0.28`, and `zcash_protocol 0.9`.
- Bumped the circuit and nullifier dependencies to published
  `voting-circuits 0.8.0`, `imt-tree 0.2.0`, `pir-types 0.2.0`, and
  `pir-client 0.3.0`.

# 0.10.2

## Security
- Bumped `voting-circuits` to `0.7.0`, which rejects Halo2 proofs that verify
  but leave trailing unread transcript bytes.

# 0.10.1

## Security
- Exact-pinned the Valar-owned voting dependency surface and related PIR/tree
  transitives used by the client features. `zcash_voting` now directly
  constrains `pir-client`, `pir-types`, `valar-spiral-rs`, `valar-ypir`,
  `imt-tree`, `voting-circuits`, `vote-commitment-tree`, and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client`.
- Bumped `vote-commitment-tree` to `0.3.1` and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client` to `0.5.1` for publishable manifest-only pin
  releases.

## Notes
- This is a supply-chain pin tightening release with no functional code
  changes.
- Scope is intentionally limited to the Valar-owned runtime voting dependency
  surface and its PIR/tree transitives. Upstream and dev-only dependency
  movement should be handled through lockfile review/CI policy rather than this
  manifest-only pinning release.

# 0.10.0

## Changed
- Bumped `voting-circuits` to `0.6.0` and removed the workspace patch override,
  so the SDK uses the published circuit crate for delegation proof generation.
- Updated wallet-side governance derivations to call the circuit crate's
  canonical helpers for nullifier domains, governance nullifiers, VAN
  commitments, and rho bindings. This is a breaking cryptographic derivation
  change for delegation proof compatibility.

# 0.9.2

## Fixed
- Matched wallet-side padded note commitments and nullifiers to the synthetic
  padding points introduced by `voting-circuits 0.5.0`, so delegation PIR
  precompute fetches the same padded IMT proofs that proof generation later
  requests.

# 0.9.1

## Added
- Added pure `share_policy`, `pir_snapshot`, and `note_bundling` APIs so wallet
  SDKs can share helper-share timing, exact PIR snapshot selection, and note
  bundle planning logic instead of reimplementing it in each app.

# 0.9.0

## Changed
- Bumped `voting-circuits` to `0.5.0` and updated callers to use its public
  re-exports and upstream circuit key caches.
- Bumped `vote-commitment-tree` to `0.3.0` and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client` to `0.5.0`.
- Removed local wallet-side test/helpers that duplicated vote-commitment and
  El Gamal internals now owned by `voting-circuits`.

# 0.8.1

## Fixed
- Recovery store operations now fail when their target bundle or vote row is
  missing instead of treating a zero-row SQLite update as success.

# 0.8.0

## Changed
- Reset the pre-launch SQLite schema history. Voting databases from interim
  schema versions are now recreated from the current `001_init.sql` baseline
  and marked as schema version 9.

# 0.7.1

## Added
- Added `NoteInfo::from_orchard_note` so SDK FFI layers can reuse the crate's
  Orchard note conversion logic instead of reconstructing `NoteInfo` fields
  themselves.

# 0.7.0

## Changed
- Removed the unused `round_id` parameter from `VotingDb::generate_hotkey`.

## Fixed
- Share payload construction now errors when the requested share is missing its
  blind instead of using empty bytes.
- Recovery now rejects stored commitment bundles that are missing their vote
  commitment tree position instead of assuming position 0.
- Delegation proof generation now requires the randomness saved when the PCZT was
  built instead of sampling fresh randomness when those fields are empty.

# 0.6.0

## Changed
- Bumped `zcash_voting` to `0.6.0`, `vote-commitment-tree` to `0.2.0`, and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client` to `0.4.0` for the breaking commitment leaf
  pagination API.
- Vote commitment tree sync now consumes paginated commitment leaf responses
  with per-block roots instead of issuing one request per height window.

# 0.5.12

## Fixed
- `zcash_voting::action::build_governance_pczt` now guarantees the returned
  `GovernancePczt` describes a single Orchard action: the spend producing
  `nf_signed`, `rk`, and `alpha` is the same action whose output produces
  `cmx_new` and `rseed_output`. The Orchard PCZT builder pads to two actions
  and shuffles spends and outputs independently, so previous calls could
  return metadata mixing two different randomized actions, which later caused
  `build_and_prove_delegation` to fail with `delegation proof result cmx_new
  does not match stored PCZT data`. The construction tail now retries
  `Builder::build_for_pczt` until `spend_idx == output_idx`, fails before
  persistence if no paired layout appears, and re-validates the serialized
  PCZT against the returned `action_index`.

# 0.5.10

## Changed
- Bumped `zcash_voting` to `0.5.10` and updated `voting-circuits` to `0.4.2`.

# 0.5.9

## Added
- Added `VotingDb::has_round` for checking round existence through the storage
  API without downstream callers depending on SQLite schema details.

# 0.5.8

## Added
- `VotingDb::setup_bundles` now persists bundle note identity hashes, and
  `VotingDb::build_governance_pczt`, `VotingDb::precompute_delegation_pir`,
  and `VotingDb::build_and_prove_delegation` reject same-position note
  substitutions for bundles set up under 0.5.8 or later. Bundles persisted by
  earlier releases retain the prior position-only check until they are
  re-setup.

## Fixed
- Delegation proof storage now checks proof-derived public inputs against the
  PCZT-derived values stored during `VotingDb::build_governance_pczt`, and
  stores the proof, public inputs, and round phase atomically.
- `VotingDb::setup_bundles` now persists all bundle rows in a single
  transaction.
- Avoided dropping the Hyper/Tokio transport runtime from inside an active Tokio
  context.

# 0.5.7

## Fixed
- `VotingDb::mark_vote_submitted` now returns an error when no persisted vote
  row matches the requested round, wallet, bundle, and proposal instead of
  treating a zero-row update as success.

# 0.5.6

## Added
- Added a `test-fixtures` feature exposing `VotingDb::insert_vote_fixture`, so
  downstream FFI tests can create vote rows through `VotingDb` instead of
  depending on SQLite schema internals.

# 0.5.5

## Fixed
- Keystone delegation submissions now reject a supplied sighash unless it matches
  the PCZT sighash stored for the bundle.

# 0.5.4

## Fixed
- Delegation submission signing now derives the sender spending key from the
  caller's ZIP-32 `account_index` instead of always using account 0.

# 0.5.3

## Fixed
- **`zcash_voting` `network_id` convention** now matches the wallet SDK everywhere
  (`zkp1::build_and_prove_delegation`, PIR `precompute_delegation_pir` padded
  nullifiers, `zkp2::derive_spending_key`, `vote_commitment::sign_cast_vote`, and
  storage helpers that take `network_id`): **0 = testnet, 1 = mainnet**. The
  padded-nullifier path had previously used the inverse mapping, so `NoteInfo`
  from the SDK could disagree with PIR precompute vs proof generation.

## Changed
- Bumped the `zcash_voting` crate version to `0.5.3`. Direct callers who flipped
  `network_id` to compensate for the old bug should pass the SDK value unchanged
  after upgrading.

# 0.5.2

## Changed
- Reissued the tree-sync transport release from the merged `main` history.
- Confirmed the Hyper/Rustls tree-sync transport against production vote-chain
  endpoints for non-empty rounds.

# 0.5.1

## Changed
- Moved vote commitment tree sync onto the injected transport boundary and
  provided a direct Hyper/Rustls transport from `zcash_voting`.
- Removed `reqwest` from `vote-commitment-tree-client`'s library path.

# 0.5.0

## Changed
- Made `client-pir` transport-agnostic. `zcash_voting` no longer pulls
  `reqwest`; callers must provide a `pir_client::Transport`.
- Added transport-aware PIR precompute/proving entry points so SDKs can provide
  their own HTTP stack.
- Consolidated PIR proof validation and client transport under the single
  `client-pir` feature.
- Added a direct Hyper/Rustls PIR transport under `client-pir` for consumers
  that do not provide their own transport.

# 0.4.1

## Added
- Split the `zcash_voting` network-facing `client` feature into granular
  `client-pir` and `client-tree-sync` features. The existing `client` feature
  remains as a backwards-compatible aggregate of both.
- Made the PIR proof conversion/validation helper available to downstream
  consumers so SDK FFI layers can validate PIR `ImtProofData` without
  enabling vote-commitment-tree sync.

## Changed
- Bumped the `zcash_voting` crate version to `0.4.1` for the additive feature
  split.
